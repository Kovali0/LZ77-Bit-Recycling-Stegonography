together i take after father large and heavy an william is like mother s folks short an thin he ought to have made something o himself bein a man an so like mother but though he s been very steady to work an kept up the farm an done his fishin too right along he never had mother s snap an power o seein things just as they be he s got excellent judgment too meditated william s sister but she could not arrive at any satisfactory decision upon what she evidently thought his failure in life i think it is well to see any one so happy an makin the most of life just as it falls to hand she said as she began to put the daguerreotypes away again but i reached out my hand to see her mother s once more a most flowerlike face of a lovely young woman in quaint dress there was in the eyes a look of anticipation and joy a far off look that sought the horizon one often sees it in seafaring families inherited by girls and boys alike from men who spend their lives at sea and are always watching for distant sails or the first loom of the land at sea there is nothing to be seen close by and this has its counterpart in a sailor s character in the large and brave and patient traits that are developed the hopeful pleasantness that one loves so in a seafarer when the family pictures were wrapped again in a big handkerchief we set forward in a narrow footpath and made our way to a lonely place that faced northward where there was more pasturage and fewer bushes and we went down to the edge of short grass above some rocky cliffs where the deep sea broke with a great noise though the wind was down and the water looked quiet a little way from shore among the grass grew such pennyroyal as the rest of the world could not provide there was a fine fragrance in the air as we gathered it sprig by sprig and stepped along carefully and mrs todd pressed her aromatic nosegay between her hands and offered it to me again and again there s nothin like it she said oh no there s no such pennyr yal as this in the state of maine it s the right pattern of the plant and all the rest i ever see is but an imitation do nt it do you good and i answered with enthusiasm there dear i never showed nobody else but mother where to find this place tis kind of sainted to me nathan my husband an i used to love this place when we was courtin and she hesitated and then spoke softly when he was lost twas just off
times welcome to our home dear aunt if you will let me call you that and and i shall use my influence to have father invite you to share our humble home forever if you only will no no bernardine replied miss rogers you have mouths enough to earn bread for one more would not signify declared bernardine and your presence beneath this roof would amply compensate me i would take a world of pleasure in working a little harder than i do now to keep you here before you give me too much hope on that point you had better talk it over with your father he may think differently from what you do he may not want to keep a tramp s boarding house she added quietly father will be sure to think as i do reiterated bernardine he has a rough exterior but the kindest of hearts beats in his rugged bosom you are right there bernardine said david moore pushing open an inner door and coming forward i could not help overhearing all that passed between you two i am sorry you have lost all your money miss rogers but that will not make any difference in the heartiness of the welcome we give you and if bernardine wants you to stay here with us stay you shall so take off your bonnet and make yourself at home chapter xix true love never does run smooth miss rogers was quite overcome by the hearty welcome she received from david moore the old basket maker and bernardine his lovely daughter it went straight to her lonely heart because she knew it was genuine friendship untainted by mercenary motives she shared bernardine s humble yet dainty apartment and fell quite naturally into being a member of the household there was one thing which puzzled her greatly and that was the sighs that would rend sweet bernardine s breast while she was sleeping the girl has some secret sorrow which she is hiding from the world she thought anxiously i must find out what it is she had been an inmate of bernardine s home for a week before she learned that the girl was soon to be wedded bernardine s father told her hinting triumphantly that that event would mean the dawn of a more prosperous future for the family as her intended husband was very rich had money to burn do nt say much about him to bernardine he added quickly for she s not in love with him by any means then why is she going to marry him asked miss rogers amazedly he has money replied david moore nodding his head wisely and that s what sharp girls are looking for nowadays i thought love was the ruling power which moved young girls hearts responded miss rogers slowly at least it used to be when i was a young girl like bernardine he laughed uneasily but made no reply as bernardine entered the room at that instant with an open letter in her hand jasper wilde has returned to the city father she said tremulously and and he is coming here this evening to see us as the girl uttered the words miss rogers was quite sure she could detect the sound of tears in her quivering voice i am very glad replied david moore endeavoring to speak lightly i shall be mighty pleased to see my prospective son in law bernardine drew back quickly her lovely face pitifully pale then turned abruptly and hurried from the room miss rogers followed her the girl went to her own apartment threw herself on her knees and burying her face in the counterpane wept such bitter passionate tears that miss rogers was alarmed for her you poor child exclaimed miss rogers sit down here beside me and tell me the whole story let me understand it i can not tell you any more i met one whom i could love and we parted i sent him away because my father had declared that i should marry this other one because of his wealth said miss rogers in a strangely hard voice no no do not do my father that injustice it was not because of his wealth i i should have had to marry him had he been the poorest man in the city it is cruel it is outrageous to ask a young girl to marry a man whom she detests it is barbarous in my opinion that is carrying parental authority too far this marriage must not take place bernardine it would be wicked a sin against god although miss rogers did her best to probe into the mystery for bernardine s sake the girl was strangely obdurate so she said no more to her on the subject just then but when she approached david moore on this topic his incoherent replies puzzled her still more i am much obliged to you for taking such an interest in bernardine s affairs but let me warn you of one thing miss rogers while you are under my roof do nt attempt to meddle with what does not concern you in any way by heeding my remark we shall keep good friends this marriage must take place the young fellow is good enough and she ll get to like him after awhile see if she does nt the harsh abrupt manner in which he uttered these words told miss rogers that little hope could be entertained from that source bernardine had almost cried herself ill by the time jasper wilde s knock was heard on the door mr moore answered the summons is there any use in my coming in asked wilde grimly coming to a halt on the threshold does your daughter consent to marry me i could not make head or tail out of your letter bernardine s answer is yes murmured the old man almost incoherently she consents for my sake though heaven knows
names of his wife s callers reading some of them aloud with comments as he read the misses delasidas i worked a big deal in futures for their father this morning nice girls it s time they were getting married mrs belthrop i tell you what it is edna you ca nt afford to snub mrs belthrop why belthrop could buy and sell us ten times over his business is worth a good round sum to me you d better write her a note mrs james highcamp hugh the less you have to do with mrs highcamp the better madame laforce came all the way from carrolton too poor old soul miss wiggs mrs eleanor boltons he pushed the cards aside mercy exclaimed edna who had been fuming why are you taking the thing so seriously and making such a fuss over it i m not making any fuss over it but it s just such seeming trifles that we ve got to take seriously such things count the fish was scorched mr pontellier would not touch it edna said she did not mind a little scorched taste the roast was in some way not to his fancy and he did not like the manner in which the vegetables were served it seems to me he said we spend money enough in this house to procure at least one meal a day which a man could eat and retain his self respect you used to think the cook was a treasure returned edna indifferently perhaps she was when she first came but cooks are only human they need looking after like any other class of persons that you employ suppose i did nt look after the clerks in my office just let them run things their own way they d soon make a nice mess of me and my business where are you going asked edna seeing that her husband arose from table without having eaten a morsel except a taste of the highly seasoned soup i m going to get my dinner at the club good night he went into the hall took his hat and stick from the stand and left the house she was somewhat familiar with such scenes they had often made her very unhappy on a few previous occasions she had been completely deprived of any desire to finish her dinner sometimes she had gone into the kitchen to administer a tardy rebuke to the cook once she went to her room and studied the cookbook during an entire evening finally writing out a menu for the week which left her harassed with a feeling that after all she had accomplished no good that was worth the name but that evening edna finished her dinner alone with forced deliberation her face was flushed and her eyes flamed with some inward fire that lighted them after finishing her dinner she went to her room having instructed the boy to tell any other callers that she was indisposed it was a large beautiful room rich and picturesque in the soft dim light which the maid had turned low she went and stood at an open window and looked out upon the deep tangle of the garden below all the mystery and witchery of the night seemed to have gathered there amid the perfumes and the dusky and tortuous outlines of flowers and foliage she was seeking herself and finding herself in just such sweet half darkness which met her moods but the voices were not soothing that came to her from the darkness and the sky above and the stars they jeered and sounded mournful notes without promise devoid even of hope she turned back into the room and began to walk to and fro down its whole length without stopping without resting she carried in her hands a thin handkerchief which she tore into ribbons rolled into a ball and flung from her once she stopped and taking off her wedding ring flung it upon the carpet when she saw it lying there she stamped her heel upon it striving to crush it but her small boot heel did not make an indenture not a mark upon the little glittering circlet in a sweeping passion she seized a glass vase from the table and flung it upon the tiles of the hearth she wanted to destroy something the crash and clatter were what she wanted to hear a maid alarmed at the din of breaking glass entered the room to discover what was the matter a vase fell upon the hearth said edna never mind leave it till morning oh you might get some of the glass in your feet ma am insisted the young woman picking up bits of the broken vase that were scattered upon the carpet and here s your ring ma am under the chair edna held out her hand and taking the ring slipped it upon her finger xviii the following morning mr pontellier upon leaving for his office asked edna if she would not meet him in town in order to look at some new fixtures for the library i hardly think we need new fixtures leonce do nt let us get anything new you are too extravagant i do nt believe you ever think of saving or putting by the way to become rich is to make money my dear edna not to save it he said he regretted that she did not feel inclined to go with him and select new fixtures he kissed her good by and told her she was not looking well and must take care of herself she was unusually pale and very quiet she stood on the front veranda as he quitted the house and absently picked a few sprays of jessamine that grew upon a trellis near by she inhaled the odor of the blossoms and thrust them into the bosom of her white morning gown the boys were dragging along the
found them his life had shaped itself was no doubt to continue always along these same lines a woman had entered his small world and instantly there was discord the disturbing element had appeared wherever the woman had put her foot a score of distressing complications had sprung up like the sudden growth of strange and puzzling flowers say mac go on let s have ut straight urged marcus leaning toward him has any duck been doing you dirt he cried his face crimson on the instant no said mcteague helplessly come along old man persisted marcus let s have ut what is the row i ll do all i can to help you it was more than mcteague could bear the situation had got beyond him stupidly he spoke his hands deep in his pockets his head rolled forward it s it s miss sieppe he said trina my cousin how do you mean inquired marcus sharply i i i don know stammered mcteague hopelessly confounded you mean cried marcus suddenly enlightened that you are that you too mcteague stirred in his chair looking at the walls of the room avoiding the other s glance he nodded his head then suddenly broke out i ca nt help it it ai nt my fault is it marcus was struck dumb he dropped back in his chair breathless suddenly mcteague found his tongue i tell you mark i ca nt help it i do nt know how it happened it came on so slow that i was that that that it was done before i knew it before i could help myself i know we re pals us two and i knew how how you and miss sieppe were i know now i knew then but that would nt have made any difference before i knew it it it there i was i ca nt help it i would nt a had ut happen for anything if i could a stopped it but i don know it s something that s just stronger than you are that s all she came there miss sieppe came to the parlors there three or four times a week and she was the first girl i had ever known and you don know why i was so close to her i touched her face every minute and her mouth and smelt her hair and her breath oh you do nt know anything about it i ca nt give you any idea i don know exactly myself i only know how i m fixed i i it s been done it s too late there s no going back why i ca nt think of anything else night and day it s everything it s it s oh it s everything i i why mark it s everything i ca nt explain he made a helpless movement with both hands never had mcteague been so excited never had he made so long a speech his arms moved in fierce uncertain gestures his face flushed his enormous jaws shut together with a sharp click at every pause it was like some colossal brute trapped in a delicate invisible mesh raging exasperated powerless to extricate himself marcus schouler said nothing there was a long silence marcus got up and walked to the window and stood looking out but seeing nothing well who would have thought of this he muttered under his breath here was a fix marcus cared for trina there was no doubt in his mind about that he looked forward eagerly to the sunday afternoon excursions he liked to be with trina he too felt the charm of the little girl the charm of the small pale forehead the little chin thrust out as if in confidence and innocence the heavy odorous crown of black hair he liked her immensely some day he would speak he would ask her to marry him marcus put off this matter of marriage to some future period it would be some time a year perhaps or two the thing did not take definite shape in his mind marcus kept company with his cousin trina but he knew plenty of other girls for the matter of that he liked all girls pretty well just now the singleness and strength of mcteague s passion startled him mcteague would marry trina that very afternoon if she would have him but would he marcus no he would not if it came to that no he would not yet he knew he liked trina he could say yes he could say he loved her she was his girl the sieppes acknowledged him as trina s young man marcus came back to the table and sat down sideways upon it well what are we going to do about it mac he said i don know answered mcteague in great distress i don want anything to to come between us mark well nothun will you bet vociferated the other no sir you bet not mac marcus was thinking hard he could see very clearly that mcteague loved trina more than he did that in some strange way this huge brutal fellow was capable of a greater passion than himself who was twice as clever suddenly marcus jumped impetuously to a resolution well say mac he cried striking the table with his fist go ahead i guess you you want her pretty bad i ll pull out yes i will i ll give her up to you old man the sense of his own magnanimity all at once overcame marcus he saw himself as another man very noble self sacrificing he stood apart and watched this second self with boundless admiration and with infinite pity he was so good so magnificent so heroic that he almost sobbed marcus made a sweeping gesture of resignation throwing out both his arms crying mac i ll give her up to you i wo nt stand between you there were actually tears
again meanwhile i took charge of the nursing of sebastian fortunately i had brought with me a good stock of jungle medicines in my little travelling case including plenty of quinine and under my careful treatment the professor passed the crisis and began to mend slowly the first question he asked me when he felt himself able to talk once more was nurse wade what has become of her for he had not yet seen her i feared the shock for him she is here with me i answered in a very measured voice she is waiting to be allowed to come and help me in taking care of you he shuddered and turned away his face buried itself in the pillow i could see some twinge of remorse had seized upon him at last he spoke cumberledge he said in a very low and almost frightened tone do nt let her come near me i ca nt bear it i ca nt bear it ill as he was i did not mean to let him think i was ignorant of his motive you ca nt bear a woman whose life you have attempted i said in my coldest and most deliberate way to have a hand in nursing you you ca nt bear to let her heap coals of fire on your head in that you are right but remember you have attempted my life too you have twice done your best to get me murdered he did not pretend to deny it he was too weak for subterfuges he only writhed as he lay you are a man he said shortly and she is a woman that is all the difference then he paused for a minute or two do nt let her come near me he moaned once more in a piteous voice do nt let her come near me i will not i answered she shall not come near you i spare you that but you will have to eat the food she prepares and you know she will not poison you you will have to be tended by the servants she chooses and you know they will not murder you she can heap coals of fire on your head without coming into your tent consider that you sought to take her life and she seeks to save yours she is as anxious to keep you alive as you are anxious to kill her he lay as in a reverie his long white hair made his clear cut thin face look more unearthly than ever with the hectic flush of fever upon it at last he turned to me we each work for our own ends he said in a weary way we pursue our own objects it suits me to get rid of her it suits her to keep me alive i am no good to her dead living she expects to wring a confession out of me but she shall not have it tenacity of purpose is the one thing i admire in life she has the tenacity of purpose and so have i cumberledge do nt you see it is a mere duel of endurance between us and may the just side win i answered solemnly it was several days later before he spoke to me of it again hilda had brought some food to the door of the tent and passed it in to me for our patient how is he now she whispered sebastian overheard her voice and cowering within himself still managed to answer better getting better i shall soon be well now you have carried your point you have cured your enemy thank god for that hilda said and glided away silently sebastian ate his cup of arrowroot in silence then he looked at me with wistful musing eyes cumberledge he murmured at last after all i ca nt help admiring that woman she is the only person who has ever checkmated me she checkmates me every time steadfastness is what i love her steadfastness of purpose and her determination move me i wish they would move you to tell the truth i answered he mused again to tell the truth he muttered moving his head up and down i have lived for science shall i wreck all now there are truths which it is better to hide than to proclaim uncomfortable truths truths that never should have been truths which help to make greater truths incredible but all the same i cannot help admiring that woman she has yorke bannerman s intellect with a great deal more than yorke bannerman s force of will such firmness such energy such resolute patience she is a wonderful creature i ca nt help admiring her i said no more to him just then i thought it better to let nascent remorse and nascent admiration work out their own natural effects unimpeded for i could see our enemy was beginning to feel some sting of remorse some men are below it sebastian thought himself above it i felt sure he was mistaken yet even in the midst of these personal preoccupations i saw that our great teacher was still as ever the pure man of science he noted every symptom and every change of the disease with professional accuracy he observed his own case whenever his mind was clear enough as impartially as he would have observed any outside patient s this is a rare chance cumberledge he whispered to me once in an interval of delirium so few europeans have ever had the complaint and probably none who were competent to describe the specific subjective and psychological symptoms the delusions one gets as one sinks into the coma for example are of quite a peculiar type delusions of wealth and of absolute power most exhilarating and magnificent i think myself a millionaire or a prime minister be sure you make a note of that in case i die if i recover
depends whether or not i shall entrust you with knowledge regarding him swear to me by the three kings of cologne that you will tell to none what i will now impart to you i swear said elsa raising her right hand and holding aloft the sword with it wilhelm is not my son nor is he kin to either of us but is the heir of the greatest enemy of our house count herbert of schonburg i lured him from his father s home as a child and now send him back as a man some time later i shall acquaint the count with the fact that the young man he captured is his only son the girl looked at her uncle her eyes wide with horror it is your purpose then that the father shall execute his own son the outlaw shrugged his shoulders the result lies not with me but with the count he was once a crusader and the teaching of his master is to the effect that the measure he metes to others the same shall be meted to him if i remember aright the tenets of his faith count herbert wreaking vengeance upon my supposed son is really bringing destruction upon his own which seems but justice if he show mercy to me and mine he is bestowing the blessed balm thereof on himself and his house in this imperfect world few events are ordered with such admirable equity as the capture of young lord wilhelm by that haughty and bloodthirsty warrior his father let us then await with patience the outcome taking care not to interfere with the designs of providence the design comes not from god but from the evil one himself it is within the power of the deity to overturn even the best plans of the fiend if it be his will let us see to it that we do not intervene between two such ghostly potentates remembering that we are but puny creatures liable to err the plot is of your making secretly held all these years with unrelenting malignity the devil himself is not wicked enough to send an innocent loyal lad to his doom in his own mother s house with his father as his executioner oh uncle uncle repent and make reparation before it is too late let the count repent and make reparation i have now nothing to do with the matter as i have said if the count is merciful he is like to be glad of it later in his life if he is revengeful visiting the sin of the father on the son innocent i think you called him then he deserves what his own hand deals out to himself but we have talked too much already i ask you to remember your oath for i have told you this so that you will not bring ridicule upon me by a womanish appeal to my own men who would but laugh at you in any case and think me a dotard in allowing women overmuch to say in the camp get you back to your women for we move camp instantly even if i were to relent as you term it the time is past for wilhelm is either dangling from the walls of castle schonburg or he is pardoned and all that we could do would be of little avail prepare you then instantly for our journey elsa with a sigh went slowly to the women s quarters her oath the most terrible that may be taken on the rhine weighing heavily upon her resolving not to break it yet determined in some way to save wilhelm the girl spent the first part of the journey in revolving plans of escape for she found as the cavalcade progressed that her uncle did not trust entirely to the binding qualities of the oath she had taken but had her closely watched as well as the expedition progressed farther and farther south in the direction of mayence vigilance was relaxed and on the evening of the second day when a camp had been selected for the night elsa escaped and hurried eastward through the forest until she came to the rhine which was to be her guide to the castle of schonburg the windings of the river made the return longer than the direct journey through the wilderness had been and in addition to this elsa was compelled to circumambulate the numerous castles climbing the hills to avoid them fearing capture and delay so it was not until the sun was declining on the sixth day after the assault on the castle that she stood weary and tattered and unkempt before the closed gates of schonburg and beat feebly with her small hand against the oak crying for admittance the guard of the gate seeing through the small lattice but a single dishevelled woman standing there anticipating treachery refused to open the little door in the large leaf until his captain was summoned who after some parley allowed the girl to enter the courtyard what do you want asked the captain curtly she asked instead of answered is your prisoner still alive the son of the outlaw yes but he would be a confident prophet who would predict as much for him at this hour to morrow take me i beg of you to the countess that is as it may be who are you and what is your business with her i shall reveal myself to her ladyship and to her will state the object of my coming your object is plain enough you are some tatterdemalion of the forest come to beg the life of your lover who hangs to morrow or i am a heathen saracen i do beseech you tell the countess that a miserable woman craves permission to speak with her what success might have attended her petition is uncertain but the problem was solved by the appearance
and as such to be honored by those who call themselves his friends and she is not to be lightly spoken of nor comment passed upon her grace beauty and bearing something too great for her station i admit lest idle tales should get abroad am i not thy friend ralph he asked with smiling eyes i have thought so at times i answered my friend s honor is my honor he went on where his lips are sealed mine open not art content content i said and pressed the hand he held out to me we reached the steps of the wharf and descending them he entered his barge rocking lazily with the advancing tide his rowers cast loose from the piles and the black water slowly widened between us from over my shoulder came a sudden bright gleam of light from the house above and i knew that mistress percy was as usual wasting good pine knots i had a vision of the many lights within and of the beauty whom the world called my wife sitting erect bathed in that rosy glow in the great armchair with the turbaned negress behind her i suppose rolfe saw the same thing for he looked from the light to me and i heard him draw his breath ralph percy thou art the very button upon the cap of fortune he said to myself my laugh sounded something of the bitterest but to him i presume it vaunted my return through the darkness to the lit room and its resplendent pearl he waved farewell and the dusk swallowed up him and his boat i went back to the house and to her she was sitting as we had left her with her small feet crossed upon the cushion beneath them her hands folded in her silken lap the air from the waving fan blowing tendrils of her dark hair against her delicate standing ruff i went and leaned against the window facing her i have been chosen burgess for this hundred i said abruptly the assembly meets next week i must be in jamestown then and for some time to come she took the fan from the negress and waved it lazily to and fro when do we go she asked at last we i answered i had thought to go alone the fan dropped to the floor and her eyes opened wide and leave me here she exclaimed leave me in these woods at the mercy of indians wolves and your rabble of servants i smiled we are at peace with the indians it would be a stout wolf that could leap this palisade and the servants know their master too well to care to offend their mistress moreover i would leave diccon in charge diccon she cried the old woman in the kitchen hath told me tales of diccon diccon bravo diccon gamester diccon cutthroat granted i said but diccon faithful as well i can trust him but i do not trust him she retorted and i wish to go to jamestown this forest wearies me her tone was imperious i must think it over i said coolly i may take you or i may not i cannot tell yet but i desire to go sir and i may desire you to stay you are a churl i bowed i am the man of your choice madam she rose with a stamp of her foot and turning her back upon me took a flower from the table and commenced to pull from it its petals i unsheathed my sword and seating myself began to polish away a speck of rust upon the blade ten minutes later i looked up from the task to receive full in my face a red rose tossed from the other side of the room the missile was followed by an enchanting burst of laughter we cannot afford to quarrel can we cried mistress jocelyn percy life is sad enough in this solitude without that nothing but trees and water all day long and not a soul to speak to and i am horribly afraid of the indians what if they were to kill me while you were away you know you swore before the minister to protect me you wo nt leave me to the mercies of the savages will you and i may go to jamestown may nt i i want to go to church i want to go to the governor s house i want to buy a many things i have gold in plenty and but this one decent dress you ll take me with you wo nt you there s not your like in virginia i told her if you go to town clad like that and with that bearing there will be talk enough and ships come and go and there are those besides rolfe who have been to london for a moment the laughter died from her eyes and lips but it returned let them talk she said what care i and i do not think your ship captains your traders and adventurers do often dine with my lord bishop this barbarous forest world and another world that i wot of are so far apart that the inhabitants of the one do not trouble those of the other in that petty village down there i am safe enough besides sir you wear a sword my sword is ever at your service madam then i may go to jamestown if you will it so with her bright eyes upon me and with one hand softly striking a rose against her laughing lips she extended the other hand you may kiss it if you wish sir she said demurely i knelt and kissed the white fingers and four days later we went to jamestown chapter vi in which we go to jamestown it was early morning when we set out on horseback for jamestown i rode in front with mistress
see what george hagar saw in mark telford s looks telford s glance went round the crowd appearing to rest for an instant on every person and for a longer time on hagar the eyes of the two men met both were immediately puzzled for each had a sensation of some subterranean origin telford immediately afterward passed out of the gate and went toward the st cloud gardens where the band was playing for a time hagar did not stir but idled with his pencil and notebook suddenly he started and hurried out in the direction telford had gone i was an ass he said to himself not to think of that at first he entered the st cloud gardens and walked round the promenade a few times but without finding him presently however alpheus richmond whose beautiful and brilliant waistcoat and brass buttons with monogram adorned showed advantageously in the morning sunshine said to him i say hagar who s that chap up there filling the door of the summer house lord rather it was telford hagar wished for the slightest pretext to go up the unfrequented side path and speak to him but his mind was too excited to do the thing naturally without a stout pretext besides though he admired the man s proportions and his uses from an artistic standpoint he did not like him personally and he said that he never could he had instinctive likes and dislikes what had startled him at the pump room and had made him come to the gardens was the conviction that this was the man to play the part in the scene which described by mrs detlor had been arranging itself in a hundred ways in his brain during the night the central figures always the same the details light tone coloring expression fusing resolving then came another and still more significant thought on this he had acted when he had got rid of richmond who begged that he would teach him how to arrange a tie as he did for which an hour was appointed he determined at all hazards to speak he had a cigar in his pocket and though to smoke in the morning was pain and grief to him he determined to ask for a match and started he was stopped by baron whose thoughts being much with the little vices of man anticipated his wishes and offered him a light in despair hagar took it and asked if he chanced to know who the stranger was baron did know assuring hagar that he sat on the gentleman s right at the same table in his hotel and was qualified to introduce him before they started he told the artist of the occurrence of the evening before and further assured him of the graces of miss mildred margrave a pearl he said not to be reckoned by loads of ivory nor jolly bricks of gold nor caravans of arab steeds nor come and have dinner with me to night and you shall see there what do you say hagar who loved the man s unique and spontaneous character as only an artist can love a subject in which he sees royal possibilities consented gladly and dropped a cordial hand on the other s shoulder the hand was dragged down and wrenched back and forth with a sturdy clasp in time to a roll of round unctuous laughter then baron took him up hurriedly and introduced him to telford with the words you two ought to know each other telford traveler officer of the hudson s bay company et cetera hagar artist good fellow et cetera then he drew back and smiled as the two men not shaking hands as he expected bowed and said they were happy to meet the talk began with the remark by hagar on the panorama below them that the thing was amusing if not seen too often but the eternal paddling round the band stand was too much like marionettes you prefer a punch and judy to marionettes asked telford yes you get a human element in a punch and judy tragedy besides it has surprises according to the idiosyncrasy of the man in the greenroom he smiled immediately remembering that his last words plagiarized mr alpheus richmond i never miss a punch and judy if i m near it said telford i enjoy the sardonic humor with which punch hustles off his victims his light heartedness when doing bloody deeds is the true temper that is if it must be done to do it with a grin is is the most absolute tragedy hagar was astonished for even the trader s information that telford spoke excellent french and had certainly been a deal on red carpet in his time did not prepare him for the sharply incisive words just uttered yet it was not incongruous with telford s appearance not even with the red sash peeping at the edge of his waistcoat they came down among the promenaders and baron being accosted by some one he left the two together exacting anew the promise from hagar regarding dinner presently hagar looked up and said abruptly you were singing outside my window last night telford s face was turned away from him when he began it came slowly toward him the eyes closed steadily with his there was no excitement only cold alertness indeed what was i singing for one thing the chant of the negro woodcutters of louisiana what part of louisiana the county of tellavie chiefly telford drew a long breath as though some suspense was over and then said how did you know it was i i could scarcely tell you i got the impression besides you are the only man i ve seen in herridon who looks likely to know it and the song which you prompted do i look like a southerner still you see i ve been in an arctic country five years
and for the last time stand face to face with the ghost of the dead in the home of the dead o white heart and black body i look into your heart and it is white as milk and the milk of innocence shall save it fool why do you strike that blow let him be who is loved of the tiger and whose love is as the love of a tiger ah what face is that in the battle follow it follow it o swift of foot but follow warily for the tongue that has lied will never plead for mercy and the hand that can betray is strong in war white heart what is death in death life lives and among the dead you shall find the life you lost for there awaits you she whom kings and waters cannot harm as the bee spoke by degrees her voice sank lower and lower till it was almost inaudible then it ceased altogether and she seemed to pass from trance to sleep hadden who had been listening to her with an amused and cynical smile now laughed aloud why do you laugh white man asked nahoon angrily i laugh at my own folly in wasting time listening to the nonsense of that lying fraud it is no nonsense white man indeed then will you tell me what it means i cannot tell you what it means yet but her words have to do with a woman and a leopard and with your fate and my fate hadden shrugged his shoulders not thinking the matter worth further argument and at that moment the bee woke up shivering drew the red snake from her head dress and coiling it about her throat wrapped herself again in the greasy kaross are you satisfied with my wisdom inkoos she asked of hadden i am satisfied that you are one of the cleverest cheats in zululand mother he answered coolly now what is there to pay the bee took no offence at this rude speech though for a second or two the look in her eyes grew strangely like that which they had seen in those of the snake when the fumes of the fire made it angry if the white lord says i am a cheat it must be so she answered for he of all men should be able to discern a cheat i have said that i ask no fee yes give me a little tobacco from your pouch hadden opened the bag of antelope hide and drawing some tobacco from it gave it to her in taking it she clasped his hand and examined the gold ring that was upon the third finger a ring fashioned like a snake with two little rubies set in the head to represent the eyes i wear a snake about my neck and you wear one upon your hand inkoos i should like to have this ring to wear upon my hand so that the snake about my neck may be less lonely there then i am afraid you will have to wait till i am dead said hadden yes yes she answered in a pleased voice it is a good word i will wait till you are dead and then i will take the ring and none can say that i have stolen it for nahoon there will bear me witness that you gave me permission to do so for the first time hadden started since there was something about the bee s tone that jarred upon him had she addressed him in her professional manner he would have thought nothing of it but in her cupidity she had become natural and it was evident that she spoke from conviction believing her own words she saw him start and instantly changed her note let the white lord forgive the jest of a poor old witch doctoress she said in a whining voice i have so much to do with death that his name leaps to my lips and she glanced first at the circle of skulls about her then towards the waterfall that fed the gloomy pool upon whose banks her hut was placed look she said simply following the line of her outstretched hand hadden s eyes fell upon two withered mimosa trees which grew over the fall almost at right angles to its rocky edge these trees were joined together by a rude platform made of logs of wood lashed down with riems of hide upon this platform stood three figures notwithstanding the distance and the spray of the fall he could see that they were those of two men and a girl for their shapes stood out distinctly against the fiery red of the sunset sky one instant there were three the next there were two for the girl had gone and something dark rushing down the face of the fall struck the surface of the pool with a heavy thud while a faint and piteous cry broke upon his ear what is the meaning of that he asked horrified and amazed nothing answered the bee with a laugh do you not know then that this is the place where faithless women or girls who have loved without the leave of the king are brought to meet their death and with them their accomplices oh they die here thus each day and i watch them die and keep the count of the number of them and drawing a tally stick from the thatch of the hut she took a knife and added a notch to the many that appeared upon it looking at nahoon the while with a half questioning half warning gaze yes yes it is a place of death she muttered up yonder the quick die day by day and down there and she pointed along the course of the river beyond the pool to where the forest began some two hundred yards from her hut the ghosts
rather timidly at the counter walk right up those stairs and turn to the left said a clerk as he opened a gate for me ascending i met a big man coming down hurriedly and with heavy steps we stood dodging each other a moment with that unfortunate co ordination of purpose men sometimes encounter when passing each other suddeniy the big man stopped in the middle of the stairway and held both of his hands above his head in god s name young man said he take your choice he spoke in a high squeaky voice that cut me with the sharpness of its irritation i went on past him and entered an open door near the top of the stairway is mr horace greeley in i enquired of a young man who sat reading papers back soon said he without looking up take a chair in a little while i heard the same heavy feet ascending the stairway two steps at a time then the man i had met came hurriedly into the room this is mr greeley said the yo mg man who was reading the great editor turned and looked at me through gold rimmed spectacles i gave him my letter out of a trembling hand he removed it from the envelope and held it close to his big kindly smooth shaven face there was a fringe of silky silver hair streaked with yellow about the lower part of his head from temple to temple it also encircled his throat from under his collar his cheeks were fall and fair as a lady s with rosy spots in them and a few freckles about his nose he laughed as he finished reading the letter are you dave brower s boy he asked in a drawling falsetto looking at me out of grey eyes and smiling with good humour by adoption i answered he was an almighty good rassler he said deliberately as he looked again at the letter what do you want to do he asked abruptly want to work on the tribune i answered good lord he said i ca nt hire everybody i tried to think of some argument but what with looking at the great man before me and answering his questions and maintaining a decent show of dignity i had enough to do do you read the tribune he asked read it ever since i can remember what do you think of the administration lot of dough faces i answered smiling as i saw he recognised his own phrase he sat a moment tapping the desk with his penholder there s so many liars here in new york he said there ought to be room for an honest man how are the crops fair i answered big crop of boys every year and now you re trying to find a market he remarked want to have you try them i answered well said he very seriously turning to his desk that came up to his chin as he sat beside it go and write me an article about rats would you advise i started to say when he interrupted me the man that gives advice is a bigger fool than the man that takes it he fleered impatiently go and do your best before he had given me this injunction he had dipped his pen and begun to write hurriedly if i had known him longer i should have known that while he had been talking to me that tireless mind of his had summoned him to its service i went out in high spirits and sat down a moment on one of the benches in the little park near by to think it all over he was going to measure my judgement my skill as a writer my resources rats i said to myself thoughtfully had read much about them they infested the ships they overran the wharves they traversed the sewers an inspiration came to me i started for the waterfront asking my way every block or two near the east river i met a policeman a big husky good hearted irishman can you tell me i said who can give me information about rats rats he repeated what d ye wa nt know about thim everything i said they ve just given me a job on the new york tribune i added proudly he smiled good naturedly he had looked through me at a glance just say tribune he said ye do nt have t say new york tribune here come along wi me he took me to a dozen or more of the dock masters give im a lift my hearty he said to the first of them he s a green i have never forgotten the kindness of that irishman whom i came to know well in good time remembering that day and others i always greeted him with a hearty god bless the irish every time i passed him and he would answer amen an save yer riverince he did not leave me until i was on my way home loaded with fact and fable and good dialect with a savour of the sea in it hope and uncle eb were sitting together in his room when i returned guess i ve got a job i said trying to be very cool about it a job said hope eagerly as she rose where with mr horace greeley i answered my voice betraying my excitement jerusalem said uncle eb is it possible that s grand said hope tell us about it then i told them of my interview with the great editor and of what i had done since ye done wonderful said uncle eb and hope showed quite as much pleasure in her own sweet way i was for going to my room and beginning to write at once but hope said it was time to be getting ready for dinner when we came down at
chance at last to that only the answer of her eyes so sweet so full of sorrow he stooped above her his whole nature torn between love and doubt you hear me he said in low broken tones but you think yourself a traitor to listen and how could i not she cried with a sudden sob and then she found her speech her heart unveiled itself if i had never never come it is my fault that she is dying only only my fault and she turned away from him to hide her face and eyes against the rock in such an agony of feeling that he almost despaired he controlled himself sharply putting aside passion collecting his thoughts for dear life you are the most innocent the most true of tender friends it is in her name that i say to you lucy be kind lucy dare to love me she raised her arm suddenly and pointed to the ground between them there she said under her breath i see her there lying dead between us he was struck with horror realising in what a grip this sane and simple nature must feel itself before it could break into such expression what could he do or say he seated himself beside her he took her hands by force lucy i know what you mean i wo nt pretend that i do nt know you think that i ought to have married my cousin that if you had not been there i should have married her i might not yet but after some time it is quite true that it might have happened would it have made eleanor happy you saw me at the villa as i am you know well that even as a friend i constantly disappointed her there seemed to be a fate upon us which made me torment and wound her when i least intended it i do nt defend myself and heaven knows i do nt blame eleanor i have always believed that these things are mysterious predestined matters of temperament deeper than our will i was deeply sincerely attached to eleanor yet when you came after those first few weeks the falsity of the whole position flashed upon me and there was the book it seemed to me sometimes that the only way of extricating us all was to destroy the book and and all that it implied or might have been thought to imply he added hurriedly oh you need nt tell me that i was a blundering and selfish fool we have all got into a horrible coil and i ca nt pose before you if i would but it is nt eleanor that would hold you back from me lucy it is nt eleanor answer me you know that he held her almost roughly scanning her face in an agony that served him well her lips moved piteously in words that he could not hear but her hands lay passive in his grasp and he hastened on ever since that nemi evening lucy i have been a new creature i will tell you no lies i wo nt say that i never loved any woman before you i will have no secrets from you you shall know all if you want to know but i do say that every passion i ever knew in my first youth seems to me now a mere apprenticeship to loving you you have become my life my very heart if anything is to be made of a fellow like me it s you that ll give me a chance lucy oh my dear do nt turn from me it s eleanor s voice speaks in mine listen to us both her colour came and went she swayed towards him fascinated by his voice conquered by the mere exhaustion of her long struggle held in the grasp of that compulsion which eleanor had laid upon her manisty perceived her weakness his eyes flamed his arm closed round her i had an instinct a vision he said almost in her ear when i set out the day dawned on me like a day of consecration the sun was another sun the earth reborn i took up my pilgrimage again looking for lucy as i have looked for her the last six weeks and everything led me right the breeze and the woods and the birds they were all in league with me they pitied me they told me where lucy was the low rushing words ceased a moment manisty looked at her took both her hands again but they could nt tell me he murmured how to please her how to make her kind to me make her listen to me lucy whom shall i go to for that she turned away her face her hands released themselves manisty hardly breathed till she said with a trembling mouth and a little sob now and then between the words it is all so strange to me so strange and so so doubtful if there were only someone here from my own people someone who could advise me is it wise for you for us both you know i m so different from you and you ll find it out perhaps more and more and if you did and were discontented with me i ca nt be sure that i could always fit myself to you i was brought up so that that i ca nt always be as easy and pleasant as other girls my mother she stood by herself often and i with her she was a grand nature but i m sure you would have thought her extravagant and perhaps hard and often i feel as though i did nt know myself what there might be in me i know i m often very stubborn suppose in a few years her eyes came back to him searching and interrogating that bent look of his in
of seeing him one day in bronze and feeling that he is all mine for he has nt even that spark of luck which so often passes for infinitesimal greatness poor dear how did you guess that she had the taint in her asked betty as they were about to land she has not a suggestion of it in her face i felt it so vaguely that i scarcely put it in words to myself until lately and i never saw such an amount of pink on finger nails in my life vi betty went in search of harriet and found her in a summer house reading an innocuous french romance which her professor had selected there was no place near by where miss trumbull might lie concealed and betty went to the point at once harriet she said i am obliged to say something horribly painful if you want to marry any man you must tell him the truth it would be a crime not to the prejudices of of southerners are deep and bitter and and oh it is a terrible thing to have to say but i must if you had children they might be black for a moment betty thought that harriet was dead she turned so gray and her gaze was so fixed but she spoke in a moment why do you say this to me now because i fear you and jack oh i hope it is not true the person who thinks you love each other may have been mistaken but i could not wait to warn you i should have told you in the beginning that when the time came either you must tell the man or i should but it was a hateful subject god knows it is hard to speak now harriet seemed to have recovered herself the colour returned slowly to her face her heavy lids descended she rose and drew herself up to her full height with the air of complete melancholy which recalled one or two other memorable occasions but there was a subtle change the attitude did not seem so natural to her as formerly your informant was only half right she said sadly i love him but he cares nothing for me he is the best the kindest of friends it is no wonder that i love him i suppose i was bound to love the first man who treated me with affectionate respect i reckon i d have fallen in love with uncle if he d been younger perhaps in europe i may get over it but he does not love me betty rose and looked at her steadily what was in the brain behind those sad reproachful eyes she laid her hand on the girl s shoulder harriet she said solemnly give me your word of honour that you will not marry him without telling him the truth it may be that he does not love you but he might and if you were without hope you would be unhappy promise me down in the depths of those melancholy eyes there was a flash then harriet lifted her head and spoke with the solemnity of one taking an oath i promise she said i will marry no man without telling him the truth this time her tone carried conviction and betty relieved sought sally carter nonsense exclaimed miss carter when betty had related the interview he is in love with her although for some reason or other he is making an elaborate effort to conceal it she spoke very convincingly said betty who would not admit doubt anything with a drop of negro blood in it will lie it ca nt help it i wish the race were exterminated i wish the english had left it in africa they certainly saddled us with an everlasting curse she was tempted to wish that mr walker had never discovered her address but although she did not love harriet she was grateful still for the opportunity to rescue her from the usual fate of her breed but assuredly she did not wish her old friend to be sacrificed again she observed him closely and came to the conclusion that harriet had spoken the truth he was gayer than of old but his health was better and he was in cheerful company not living his days and nights in his lonely damp old house on the potomac river he appeared to enjoy talking to harriet but there was nothing lover like in his attitude and he was almost her guardian true he was occasionally moody and absent but a man must retain a few of his old spots and if he avoided somewhat the cousin whom he had once loved to melancholy it was doubtless because she found him as uninteresting as she found all men but one and was not at sufficient pains to conceal her indifference and then she admitted with a laugh that in the back of her mind she had never acknowledged the possibility of his loving another woman she but half admitted that she wished to believe no storm was gathering under her roof she had no desire to handle a tragedy vii it was saturday morning betty arose at four brewed herself a cup of coffee over a spirit lamp and ate several biscuit with it she hoped senator north would take the same precaution healthy animals when hungry cannot take much interest in each other she dressed herself in airy white with a blue ribbon in her hair there was no necessity for a hat at that hour in the morning but she took a white organdie one down to the boat and put it under a seat lest she be late in returning and the sun freckling it was faintly dawn as she pulled out into the middle of the lake and rowed toward its northern end even the trailing thickets on the water s edge looked black and
war in these leisurely beguilements the days passed until one morning attusah s fears and presentiments were realized in their seizure by a party of cherokees who swooped down upon their hermitage and bore them off by force to the council house of the town of citico where atta kulla kulla and a number of other head men had assembled to discuss the critical affairs of the tribe and decide on its future policy so critical indeed was the situation that it seemed to macvintie that they might well dispense with notice of two factors so inconsiderable in the scale of national importance as the ada wehi and his captive but one was a british prisoner calculated to expiate in a degree with his life the woe and ruin his comrades had wrought the more essential was this course since the triumph of putting him to the torture and death would gratify and reanimate many whose zeal was flagging under an accumulation of anguish and helpless defeat and stimulate them to renewed exertions for before the cherokees would sue for peace they waited long in the hope that the french would yet be enabled to convey to them a sufficient supply of powder to renew and prosecute the war as to the arrest of the other attusah of kanootare this was necessary in the event that submission to the british government became inevitable for since he claimed to be a ghost surely never was spectre so reckless he had indeed appeared to so many favored individuals that the english might fairly have cause to doubt his execution in satisfaction of his crimes against the government and the breach of faith on the part of the cherokee rulers in this conspicuous instance might well preclude the granting of any reasonable terms of peace now and subject the whole nation to added hardship this was the argument advanced by atta kulla kulla as he stood and addressed his colleagues who sat on buffalo skins in a circle on the floor of the council house of citico the usual dome shaped edifice daubed within and without with the rich red clay of the country and situated on a high artificial mound in the centre of the town the council fire alone gave light flashing upon the slender figure and animated face of this chief who although of slighter physique and lower stature than his compeers wielded by reason of his more intellectual qualities so potent an influence among them the oratorical gifts of atta kulla kulla had signally impressed europeans of culture and experience imagine then the effect on the raw young highland soldier hearing the flow of language watching the appropriate and forceful gestures noting the responsive sentiment in the fire lit countenances of the circle of feather crested indians yet comprehending little save that it was a masterpiece of cogent reasoning richly eloquent and that every word was as a fagot to the flames and a pang to the torture attusah of kanootare the northward warrior rose to reply in defense of himself and his captive and atta kulla kulla listened as courteously as the rest although the speech of the ada wehi depended like the oratory of many young men chiefly on a magical assurance he had an ally however in the dominant superstition of the cherokees numbers of the warriors now ascribed their recent disasters to the neglect of various omens or the omission of certain propitiatory observances of their ancient religion or the perpetration of deeds known to be adversely regarded by the ruling spirits of war moreover they were all aware that this man had been killed left for dead reported as dead to the british government which accepted the satisfaction thus offered for his crimes the deeds themselves however accounted by him and the rest of the tribe praiseworthy and the achievements of war and here he was protesting that he was dead and a ghost akee o hoosa akee o hoosa tsida wei yu he cried continually indeed this seemed to be the only reasonable method of accounting for the renewed presence in the world of a man known to be dead this was his status he argued he was a dead man and this was his captive the cherokee nation could not pretend to follow with its control the actions of a dead man they themselves had pronounced him dead he had no place in the war he had been forbidden on account of his official death to compete for the honors of the campaign apart from his former status as a cherokee merely as a supernatural being a spirit an ada wehi he had captured this british soldier who was therefore the property of a dead man and the cherokee law of all things and before all things forbade interference with the effects of the dead despite the curling contempt on the lip of atta kulla kulla the council did not immediately acquiesce in his view and thus for a time flattered the hope of the ada wehi that they were resting in suspension on the details of this choice argument there was an illogical inversion of values in the experience of the tribe and while they could not now accept the worthless figments of long ago it was not vouchsafed to them to enjoy the substantial merits of the new order of things reason powder diplomacy had brought the cherokee nation to a point of humiliation to which superstition savagery and the simplicities of the tomahawk had never descended in the good old times reason was never so befuddled of aspect civilization never so undesired as now in their own expanded outlook at life however they could not afford to ignore the views of atta kulla kulla the advocate of all the newer methods in so important a matter as the release of a british prisoner of war on the strange pretext that his captor was a ghost of a peculiar spectral
a leap like a mad thing the man was connor connor the boss of the loading gang the man who had seduced his wife who had sent him to prison and wrecked his home ruined his life he stood there staring with the light shining full upon him jurgis had often thought of connor since coming back to packingtown but it had been as of something far off that no longer concerned him now however when he saw him alive and in the flesh the same thing happened to him that had happened before a flood of rage boiled up in him a blind frenzy seized him and he flung himself at the man and smote him between the eyes and then as he fell seized him by the throat and began to pound his head upon the stones the woman began screaming and people came rushing in the lantern had been upset and extinguished and it was so dark they could not see a thing but they could hear jurgis panting and hear the thumping of his victim s skull and they rushed there and tried to pull him off precisely as before jurgis came away with a piece of his enemy s flesh between his teeth and as before he went on fighting with those who had interfered with him until a policeman had come and beaten him into insensibility and so jurgis spent the balance of the night in the stockyards station house this time however he had money in his pocket and when he came to his senses he could get something to drink and also a messenger to take word of his plight to bush harper harper did not appear however until after the prisoner feeling very weak and ill had been hailed into court and remanded at five hundred dollars bail to await the result of his victim s injuries jurgis was wild about this because a different magistrate had chanced to be on the bench and he had stated that he had never been arrested before and also that he had been attacked first and if only someone had been there to speak a good word for him he could have been let off at once but harper explained that he had been downtown and had not got the message what s happened to you he asked i ve been doing a fellow up said jurgis and i ve got to get five hundred dollars bail i can arrange that all right said the other though it may cost you a few dollars of course but what was the trouble it was a man that did me a mean trick once answered jurgis who is he he s a foreman in brown s or used to be his name s connor and the other gave a start connor he cried not phil connor yes said jurgis that s the fellow why good god exclaimed the other then you re in for it old man i ca nt help you not help me why not why he s one of scully s biggest men he s a member of the war whoop league and they talked of sending him to the legislature phil connor great heavens jurgis sat dumb with dismay why he can send you to joliet if he wants to declared the other ca nt i have scully get me off before he finds out about it asked jurgis at length but scully s out of town the other answered i do nt even know where he is he s run away to dodge the strike that was a pretty mess indeed poor jurgis sat half dazed his pull had run up against a bigger pull and he was down and out but what am i going to do he asked weakly how should i know said the other i should nt even dare to get bail for you why i might ruin myself for life again there was silence ca nt you do it for me jurgis asked and pretend that you did nt know who i d hit but what good would that do you when you came to stand trial asked harper then he sat buried in thought for a minute or two there s nothing unless it s this he said i could have your bail reduced and then if you had the money you could pay it and skip how much will it be jurgis asked after he had had this explained more in detail i do nt know said the other how much do you own i ve got about three hundred dollars was the answer well was harper s reply i m not sure but i ll try and get you off for that i ll take the risk for friendship s sake for i d hate to see you sent to state s prison for a year or two and so finally jurgis ripped out his bankbook which was sewed up in his trousers and signed an order which bush harper wrote for all the money to be paid out then the latter went and got it and hurried to the court and explained to the magistrate that jurgis was a decent fellow and a friend of scully s who had been attacked by a strike breaker so the bail was reduced to three hundred dollars and harper went on it himself he did not tell this to jurgis however nor did he tell him that when the time for trial came it would be an easy matter for him to avoid the forfeiting of the bail and pocket the three hundred dollars as his reward for the risk of offending mike scully all that he told jurgis was that he was now free and that the best thing he could do was to clear out as quickly as possible and so jurgis overwhelmed with gratitude and relief took the dollar and fourteen cents
even excited some compunction in the breast of benita what would his feelings be she wondered when he found that they had run away leaving him to deal with their joint undertaking single handed almost was she minded to tell him the whole truth yet and this was a curious evidence of the man s ascendancy over her she did not perhaps she felt that to do so would be to put an end to their scheme since then by argument blandishments threats force or appeal to their sense of loyalty it mattered not which he would bring about its abandonment but she wanted to fulfil that scheme to be free of bambatse its immemorial ruins its graveyard cave and the ghoul jacob meyer who could delve among dead bones and in living hearts with equal skill and insight and yet was unable to find the treasure that lay beneath either of them so they hid the truth and talked with feverish activity about other things such as the drilling of the makalanga and the chances of an attack by the matabele which happily now seemed to be growing small also of the conditions of their cattle and the prospect of obtaining more to replace those that had died indeed benita went farther in her new found zeal of deception she proceeded to act a lie yes even with her father s reproachful eyes fixed upon her incidentally she mentioned that they were going to have an outing to climb down the ladder and visit the makalanga camp between the first and second walls and mix with the great world for a few hours also to carry their washing to be done there and bring up some clean clothes and certain books which she had left below jacob came out of his thoughts and calculations and listened gloomily i have half a mind to come with you he said words at which benita shivered it certainly is most cursed lonesome in that cave and i seem to hear things in it as though those old bones were rattling sounds like sighs and whispers too which are made by the draught well why do nt you asked benita it was a bold stroke but it succeeded if he had any doubts they vanished and he answered at once because i have not the time we have to get this business finished one way or another before the wet season comes on and we are drowned out of the place with rain or rotted by fever take your afternoon out miss clifford every maid of all work is entitled to as much and i am afraid that is your billet here only he added with that care for her safety which he always showed in his more temperate moods pray be careful clifford to get back before sundown that wall is too risky for your daughter to climb in the dusk call me from the foot of it you have the whistle and i will come down to help her up i think i ll go with you after all no i wo nt i made myself so unpleasant to them yesterday that those makalanga ca nt wish to see any more of me at present i hope you will have a more agreeable afternoon than i shall why do nt you take a ride outside the wall your horses are fat and want exercise and i do not think that you need be afraid of the matabele then without waiting for an answer he rose and left them mr clifford looked after him doubtfully oh i know said benita it seems horribly mean
