was only by retrospect you could be made aware of the amazing variety of ideas that had been presented mr clare certainly found few men in this remote situation that were capable of participating in his ideas and amusements it has been among the weaknesses of great men to fly to solitude and converse with woods and groves rather than with a circle of strong and comprehensive minds like their own from the moment of mr falkland s arrival in the neighbourhood mr clare distinguished him in the most flattering manner to so penetrating a genius there was no need of long experience and patient observation to discover the merits and defects of any character that presented itself the materials of his judgment had long since been accumulated and at the close of so illustrious a life he might almost be said to see through nature at a glance what wonder that he took some interest in a mind in a certain degree congenial with his own but to mr tyrrel s diseased imagination every distinction bestowed on his neighbour seemed to be expressly intended as an insult to him on the other hand mr clare though gentle and benevolent in his remonstrances to a degree that made the taking offence impossible was by no means parsimonious of praise or slow to make use of the deference that was paid him for the purpose of procuring justice to merit it happened at one of those public meetings at which mr falkland and mr tyrrel were present that the conversation in one of the most numerous sets into which the company was broken turned upon the poetical talents of the former a lady who was present and was distinguished for the acuteness of her understanding said she had been favoured with a sight of a poem he had just written entitled an ode to the genius of chivalry which appeared to her of exquisite merit the curiosity of the company was immediately excited and the lady added she had a copy in her pocket which was much at their service provided its being thus produced would not be disagreeable to the author the whole circle immediately entreated mr falkland to comply with their wishes and mr clare who was one of the company enforced their petition nothing gave this gentleman so much pleasure as to have an opportunity of witnessing and doing justice to the exhibition of intellectual excellence mr falkland had no false modesty or affectation and therefore readily yielded his consent mr tyrrel accidentally sat at the extremity of this circle it cannot be supposed that the turn the conversation had taken was by any means agreeable to him he appeared to wish to withdraw himself but there seemed to be some unknown power that as it were by enchantment retained him in his place and made him consent to drink to the dregs the bitter potion which envy had prepared for him the poem was read to the rest of the company by mr clare whose elocution was scarcely inferior to his other accomplishments simplicity discrimination and energy constantly attended him in the act of reading and it is not easy to conceive a more refined delight than fell to the lot of those who had the good fortune to be his auditors the beauties of mr falkland s poem were accordingly exhibited with every advantage the successive passions of the author were communicated to the hearer what was impetuous and what was solemn were delivered with a responsive feeling and a flowing and unlaboured tone the pictures conjured up by the creative fancy of the poet were placed full to view at one time overwhelming the soul with superstitious awe and at another transporting it with luxuriant beauty the character of the hearers upon this occasion has already been described they were for the most part plain unlettered and of little refinement poetry in general they read when read at all from the mere force of imitation and with few sensations of pleasure but this poem had a peculiar vein of glowing inspiration this very poem would probably have been seen by many of them with little effect but the accents of mr clare carried it home to the heart he ended and as the countenances of his auditors had before sympathised with the passions of the composition so now they emulated each other in declaring their approbation their sensations were of a sort to which they were little accustomed one spoke and another followed by a sort of uncontrollable impulse and the rude and broken manner of their commendations rendered them the more singular and remarkable but what was least to be endured was the behaviour of mr clare he returned the manuscript to the lady from whom he had received it and then addressing mr falkland said with emphasis and animation ha this is as it should be it is of the right stamp i have seen too many hard essays strained from the labour of a pedant and pastoral ditties distressed in lack of a meaning they are such as you sir that we want do not forget however that the muse was not given to add refinements to idleness but for the highest and most invaluable purposes act up to the magnitude of your destiny a moment after mr clare quitted his seat and with mr falkland and two or three more withdrew as soon as they were gone mr tyrrel edged further into the circle he had sat silent so long that he seemed ready to burst with gall and indignation mighty pretty verses said he half talking to himself and not addressing any particular person why ay the verses are well enough damnation i should like to know what a ship load of such stuff is good for why surely said the lady who had introduced mr falkland s ode on the present occasion you must allow that poetry is an
he immediately penetrated the cause and observed that my very countenance told him he was no longer a welcome guest to me i asked him if he ought so to be since his motives for seeking admission were unworthy of being communicated to my friends that he said was not the case but that prudence in the present instance required a temporary concealment he then undertook to exculpate himself from blame assuring me that as soon as i should discountenance the expectations of mr boyer and discontinue the reception of his address his intentions should be made known he was enlarging upon this topic when we heard a footstep approaching us and looking up saw mr boyer within a few paces of the arbor confusion seized us both we rose involuntarily from our seats but were mute as statues he spoke not a word but casting a look of indignant accusation at me a glance which penetrated my very soul turned on his heel and walked hastily back to the house i stood a few moments considering what course to take though shame and regret had almost taken from me the power of thought major sanford took my hand i withdrew it from him i must leave you said i where will you go said he i will go and try to retrieve my character it has suffered greatly by this fatal interview he threw himself at my feet and exclaimed leave me not eliza i conjure you not to leave me let me go now i rejoined or i bid you farewell forever i flew precipitately by him and went into the parlor where i found mr boyer and my mamma the one traversing the room in the greatest agitation the other in a flood of tears their appearance affected me and i wept like an infant when i had a little recovered myself i begged him to sit down he answered no i then told him that however unjustifiable my conduct might appear perhaps i might explain it to his satisfaction if he would hear me that my motives were innocent though they doubtless wore the aspect of criminality in his view he sternly replied that no palliation could avail that my motives were sufficiently notorious he accused me of treating him ill of rendering him the dupe of coquetting artifice of having an intrigue with major sanford and declared his determination to leave me forever as unworthy of his regard and incapable of love gratitude or honor there was too much reason in support of his accusations for me to gainsay them had his impetuosity suffered me to attempt it but in truth i had no inclination to self defence my natural vivacity had forsaken me and i listened without interrupting him to the fluency of reproachful language which his resentment inspired he took a very solemn and affectionate leave of my mamma thanking her for her politeness and wishing her much future felicity he attempted to address me i suppose somewhat in the same way but his sensibility somewhat overcame him and he only took my hand and bowing in silence departed the want of rest for two long nights together the exercise of mind and conflict of passions which now tortured my breast were too much for me to support when i saw that he was gone that he had actually forsaken me i fainted my mamma with the assistance of the maid soon restored me when i opened my eyes and beheld this amiable and tender parent watching and attending me with the most anxious concern without one reproachful word without one accusing look my reflections upon the part i had acted in defeating her benevolent wishes were exquisitely afflictive but we mutually forbore to mention the occasion of my illness and i complied with her advice to take some refreshment and retire to my chamber i am so much fatigued by the exertions of the day that rest is absolutely necessary and i lay aside my pen to seek it friday morning when i shall again receive the balmy influence of sleep i know not it has absolutely forsaken me at present i have had a most restless night every awakening idea presented itself to my imagination whether i had sustained a real loss in mr boyer s departure reflections on my own misconduct with the censure of my friends and the ill natured remarks of my enemies excited the most painful anxiety in my mind i am going down but how shall i see my mamma to her i will confess my faults in her maternal breast repose my cares and by her friendly advice regulate my conduct had i done this before i might have escaped this trouble and saved both her and myself many distressing emotions friday evening i have had a long conversation with my mamma which has greatly relieved my mind she has soothed me with the most endearing tenderness mr atkins with whom mr boyer lodged while in town called here this afternoon i did not see him but he told my mamma that mr boyer had returned home and left a letter for me which he had promised to convey with his own hand by this i am convinced that the die is absolutely cast with respect to him and that no attempts on my part to bring about a reconciliation would be either prudent or successful he has penetrated the cause of my proceedings and such is his resentment that i am inclined not much to regret his avoiding another interview my excuses would be deemed utterly insufficient and truth would not befriend and justify me as i know you are impatient to hear from me i will now despatch this long letter without any other addition than that i am your sincere friend eliza wharton letter xlii to mr charles deighton hartford well charles the show is over as we yankees say and the
time to be visible only by fits this token of approaching land affected me as much as if i had reached the threshhold of my friend s dwelling at length we entered the port and i viewed with high raised but inexplicable feelings objects with which i had been from infancy familiar the flag staff erected on the battery recalled to my imagination the pleasures of the evening and morning walks which i had taken on that spot with the lost constantia the dream was fondly cherished that the figure which i saw loitering along the terrace was her s on disembarking i gazed at every female passenger in hope that it was she whom i sought an absence of three years had obliterated from my memory none of the images which attended me on my departure chapter xxiv after a night of repose rather than of sleep i began the search after my friend i went to the house which the dudleys formerly inhabited and which had been the asylum of my infancy it was now occupied by strangers by whom no account could be given of its former tenants i obtained directions to the owner of the house he was equally unable to satisfy my curiosity the purchase had been made at a public sale and terms had been settled not with dudley but with the sheriff it is needless to say that the history of craig s imposture and its consequences were confirmed by every one who resided at that period in new york the dudleys were well remembered and their disappearance immediately after their fall had been generally noticed but whither they had retired was a problem which no one was able to solve this evasion was strange by what motives the dudleys were induced to change their ancient abode could be vaguely guessed my friend s grandfather was a native of the west indies descendants of the same stock still resided in tobago they might be affluent and to them it was possible that mr dudley in this change of fortune had betaken himself for relief this was a mournful expedient since it would raise a barrier between my friend and myself scarcely to be surmounted constantia s mother was stolen by mr dudley from a convent at amiens there were no affinities therefore to draw them to france her grandmother was a native of baltimore of a family of some note by name ridgeley this family might still exist and have either afforded an asylum to the dudleys or at least be apprised of their destiny it was obvious to conclude that they no longer existed within the precincts of new york a journey to baltimore was the next expedient this journey was made in the depth of winter and by the speediest conveyance i made no more than a day s sojourn in philadelphia the epidemic by which that city had been lately ravaged i had not heard of till my arrival in america its devastations were then painted to my fancy in the most formidable colours a few months only had elapsed since its extinction and i expected to see numerous marks of misery and dispopulation to my no small surprize however no vestiges of this calamity were to be discerned all houses were open all streets thronged and all faces thoughtless or busy the arts and the amusements of life seemed as sedulously cultivated as ever little did i then think what had been and what at that moment was the condition of my friend i stopt for the sake of respite from fatigue and did not therefore pass much time in the streets perhaps had i walked seasonably abroad we might have encountered each other and thus have saved ourselves from a thousand anxieties at baltimore i made myself known without the formality of introduction to the ridgeleys they acknowledged their relationship to mr dudley but professed absolute ignorance of his fate indirect intercourse only had been maintained formerly by dudley with his mother s kindred they had heard of his misfortune a twelvemonth after it happened but what measures had been subsequently pursued their kinsman had not thought proper to inform them the failure of this expedient almost bereft me of hope neither my own imagination nor the ridgeleys could suggest any new mode by which my purpose was likely to be accomplished to leave america without obtaining the end of my visit could not be thought of without agony and yet the continuance of my stay promised me no relief from my uncertainties on this theme i ruminated without ceasing i recalled every conversation and incident of former times and sought in them a clue by which my present conjectures might be guided one night immersed alone in my chamber my thoughts were thus employed my train of meditation was on this occasion new from the review of particulars from which no satisfaction had hitherto been gained i passed to a vague and comprehensive retrospect mr dudley s early life his profession of a painter his zeal in this pursuit and his reluctance to quit it were remembered would he not revert to this profession when other means of subsistence were gone it is true similar obstacles with those which had formerly occasioned his resort to a different path existed at present and no painter of his name was to be found in philadelphia baltimore or new york but would it not occur to him that the patronage denied to his skill by the frugal and unpolished habits of his countrymen might with more probability of success be sought from the opulence and luxury of london nay had he not once affirmed in my hearing that if he ever were reduced to poverty this was the method he would pursue this conjecture was too bewitching to be easily dismissed every new reflection augmented its force i was suddenly raised by it from the deepest melancholy to the region
taken it for a knob on the bark of the tree all three now returned to watch the manoeuvres of the birds that not having seen them by the nest still continued playing among the flowers the boys stole as near as possible keeping behind a large bunch of hanging vines lucien was nearest and his face was within a few feet of the little creatures so that he could observe every motion they made he was soon gratified with a sight that determined his point for him a swarm of small blue winged flies attracted his attention they were among the blossoms sometimes resting upon them and sometimes flitting about from one to another he saw the birds several times dash at them with open bills and pick them from their perch so the question was decided the humming birds were insect eaters after a while the female flew off to her nest leaving the male still among the flowers the curiosity of the boys was now satisfied and they were about to return to the tent when lucien suddenly made a motion whispering the others to remain silent francois first caught sight of the object which had caused this behaviour on the part of his brother and then basil saw it a hideous object it was crouching among the leaves now crawling sideways now making short springs and then hiding itself went a fearful looking creature it was about the size of one of the birds but far different in appearance its body consisted of two pieces joined about the middle and covered all over with a reddish brown wool or hair that stood upright like bristles it had ten limbs long crooked and covered with hair like the body two curved claw like antennae or feelers in front and two horns projecting behind so that but for the sharp fiery eyes of the creature it would have been difficult to tell its head from its hinder part its rusty colour its ill shaped body and hairy legs combined with the piercing look from its eyes gave it a most vicious appearance such as belongs less or more to all of its race for it was of the race aranea or spiders the leaping tarantula whispered lucien to his brothers see he continued it is after the ruby throat this was evident step by step and leap after leap it was approaching the cluster of blossoms where the humming bird was at the moment engaged its eyes were bent eagerly upon the latter and whenever it flew up from the flowers and whirred idly about the tarantula squatted itself closely hiding behind the leaves or shanks of the vines on the other hand when the bird settled a moment and appeared busily feeding the skulking creature would advance a stage nearer either by a quick run or a leap when it would again conceal itself and await a fresh opportunity as the bird flitted about a good deal the spider had frequently to change its direction in following the former after one of its short flights settled into a pet flower directly in front of where the latter lay crouching it did not enter the cup of the flower but remained at the mouth poised upon its whirring wings while with its long prehensile tongue it drew out the honey it had scarcely been a moment in this position when the tarantula sprang forward and clutched it round the body with his antennae the bird with a wild chirrup like that of a distressed cricket flew outward and upwards its wings were still free and all expected it would carry off the spider that was now seen clinging around it not so however on getting a few feet from the flower its flight appeared to be suddenly checked and although it still kept in the air flying first one way and then another it was evident that something restrained it from getting clear off on looking more attentively a fine silk like line was seen stretching from the trees to the fluttering creature it was the thread of the spider and this it was that prevented his victim from carrying him into the air the little wings soon ceased to move and both bird and spider fell to the end of the thread where they hung for a moment suspended the boys could see that the bird was dead and the mandibles of the tarantula were buried in its shining threat francois would have rushed forward to kill the destroyer but lucien who was too ardent a naturalist to have his lesson thus interrupted restrained his more impetuous brother and all three remained quiet as before the tarantula now commenced reeling in his line for the purpose of carrying his prey up among the branches where he had his nest the boys looked upward to discover the latter there sure enough was the web in a shaded corner stretching its meshes from a large liana to the trunk of the tupelo and towards this point the spider now slowly progressed with his lifeless victim as they watched his motions their eyes were caught by a shining object that moved along the wrinkled bark of the liana as the vine was nearly a foot in diameter and of a deep ferruginous colour this object was the more apparent against its dark ground for it was a creature of brilliant hues it was an animal of the lizard species and if any lizard could be considered beautiful this one might have been so called but the hideous half human form of these animals their piercing looks their stealthy and predatory habits and above all the knowledge that the bite of several of their species is poisonous combine to render them objects that excite disgust and awe rather than admiration this one as we have already said was of the most brilliant colour the whole of its upper surface was a
mr sheldon laughed at first at the whim she had conceived and endeavoured to rally her out of it but finding that it was to her a matter of serious importance and thinking there could be neither harm nor impropriety in granting her request he acceded to her wishes and she was ever after called dorcasina about two years after this a circumstance happened which formed an important era in the life of miss dorcasina mr sheldon one day received a letter from an old esteemed friend in virginia whom he had not seen for fifteen years informing him of his intention of making him a visit adding that he should bring with him his only son the stay and prop of his declining age and the darling of his fondest affections lysander by which name we shall cull the young gentlemen was about twenty five his person was noble and commanding his countenance open and liberal and his address manly and pleasing his understanding was rather solid than brilliant and much improved by education and travel his ideas of domestic happiness were just and rational and he judged from what he had observed that an agreeable matrimonial connexion was much the happiest state in life he therefore wished to marry but there happened to be no lady in the circle of his acquaintance who perfectly both satisfied his judgment and pleased his fancy miss dorcasina on perusing the letter handed by her father thought the time wag now come when she should experience the sweet satisfaction of loving and being loved the similarity of their circumstances lysander am only son and she an only daughter the old gentleman s coming so far to see her father his never having done it before and his bringing his son with him all served to confirm her in the opinion that he was the person decreed by the stars to become her husband she would to be sure have been better pleased had their acquaintance commenced in a more romantic manner she wished that in passing by his carriage had broken down and he had been brought in wounded or that he had accidentally met her scouring the woods on horseback an amusement in which she took great delight and that her horse being unruly he had arrived just in time to save her from falling or which would have been still more to her taste that some resolute fellow in love with her to distraction but who had made no impression on her heart had carried her off by force to marry her and that lysander had rescued her by his gallantry and conveyed her back in safety to the arms of her distressed parent but as none of these romantic adventures with which she had been so delighted in novels had ever happened to her she thought she must be satisfied if at their first interview he beheld her with raptures of delight and of this she entertained not a shadow of doubt the night previous to the day on which with alternate emotions of hope fear and pleasure she expected the arrival of lysander she returned at her usual hour to her chamber attended by a female domestic who having been brought up in the family from seven years old had become her confidante and favourite this she considered indispensible for it would have been entirely out of character and setting aside a most essential circumstance in the life of a heroine not to have had either a friend to whom she could confide the secret of her love or a maid who could be bribed by an enamorato to place a letter in her way and then confidentially assert that she knew not from whence it came both these characters are frequently united in the same person as was the case in the present instance for there being no female among her acquaintance in the neighbourhood whose notions of love were so refined or if you please so romantic as were those of miss dorcnsina she declined all intimacy with them and preferred betty to the double capacity of servant and confidante betty was a few years older than her mistress she was a good hearted honest creature possessed of a tolerably good natural understanding but very ignorant and extremely superstitious after dorcasina had disposed herself in bed she requested betty to sit down by her bedside saying she had something of consequence to communicate betty having seated herself in an attentive posture dorcasiha began by informing her that it was impressed on her mind that she and the young gentleman who was next day expected should at first sight fall violently in love with each other and that she had not the least doubt but he was the person destined by heaven to become her husband betty remaining silent for indeed she was at a loss for a reply dorcasina thus continued though i know that love is stronger than death and that with a beloved object a person may be happy on the top of the alleganies or among the snows of greenland yet i must confess i shall feel a sensible pain at quitting my dear and affectionate father and this delightful spot where i have passed all my life and to which i feel the strongest attachment but what gives me the greatest pain is that i shall be obliged to live in virginia he served by slaves arid be supported by the sweat toil and blood of that unfortunate and miserable part of mankind perhaps ma am said betty lysander and his father treat their slaves well and they live comfortable and happy comfortable they may be replied dorcasina but slavery and happiness are in my opinion totally incompatible disguise thyself as thou wilt still slavery thou art a bitter pill they complain of the idle thievish unfaithful disposition of their slaves but let the proprietors in their turn be degraded to servitude

his loquacious conductor entertained him on the road with a description of his peggy and her family and leander though he smiled at his simplicity could not but admire his disinterested generosity and warm benevolence these were qualities of the heart and under whatever form they were exhibited were worthy of admiration the carriage at length stopped at the door of the cottage leander s heart bounded with expectation as he stepped over the threshold in a moment he found himself in the presence of his amelia they rushed to each other s arms and those who have felt the keen rapture of a safe return can only imagine the feelings of two fond hearts glowing with undivided affection amelia soon recollected herself and rapidly withdrew her hand what dow this mean exclaimed he oh my amelia when

cheered her desponding spirits by representing in lively colours the joy of her parents on seeing her return we must pass over in silence the scene of their interview parental and filial affection

impetuosity of a torrent might indeed be overwhelmed but not rent asunder three days intervened and the lovers had no interview in the hour of misfortune when oppressed with a multiplicity of thoughts to disburthen the mind either by writing or conversation gives relief to pain and transquillity to the unquiet borne down with sorrowing reflections ira took the determination of communicating his thoughts to isabella the unfortunate bride was sitting heavy melancholy musing twas at the decline of day the parting sun shot a horizontal beam through the crimson curtains ira entered and beheld in the person of his beloved the figure of patience on a monument as described by shakespeare smiling at grief he took her hand she looked up arose my husband my brother the young man agitated by a thousand sensations grew gradually composed isabella i must see you no more how are my senses bewildered in this meeting i find even now that to meet your eye is at once my pleasure and my perdition why do i suppress my feelings why check the tears which involuntarily burst from my eyes peace ira peace give liberty to your sensations to act themselves why dam up the streams of thy tears are they not the characteristicks of nature to designate an honest heart to remain in your presence my sister my wife is willingly to swim into the vortex of destruction i have imposed upon myself a resolve therefore to see you no more convinced that absence from you will conduce to my welfare isabella manifested evident symptoms of dislike at this resolution will you fly and suffer me to sink into the gulf of despair for never more shall i appear in the world if uncomforted uncountenanced unsupported by you no matter by what title i call you still are you my stay and my staff the young husband imagined he proceeded systematically let us be ruled by reason in all distress mankind imbibe consolation from two sources in dissipation is sought a temporary forgetfulness but experience evinces there is no lethe for love in time or absence we trust for relief but how vain the hope of future repose i will strike a blow at the root i will depart with all imaginable expedition i will seek redress in the bosom of the mercantile world busied with novelty and engaged in regular pursuits i will teach my mind to contemplate other objects and to forget the image of isabella which has so long possest my heart and obtruded itself into every action of my life perhaps my future conduct may be tinged with the melancholy of this adventure i will yet remember you with respect what is more with tenderness a new era is commenced in the history of my life i am no more what i was hitherto i have conceived of human nature a character which it is a duty to wear now i read them as they are and feel myself a better man a better citizen though less philanthropick regarding myself i shall be rich and be capacitated to fulfil those offices of tenderness and charity which i have heretofore only known in theory for one favourable circumstance i pay my gratitude to the bounty of heaven the discovery and termination of an unfortunate passion has not sunk me to that stupid apathy which absorbs the senses but has inspired me with that resolution which is the soul of action doomed to look on you only in the light and to call you only by the appellation of sister reminded by every object of the calamitous event of our loves i go lorenzo in the ardour of friendship provides my passage and i am forthwith to embark isabella viewed the project of her friend with pity and a smile which indicated her contempt of its practicability your forced pretended resolution my dear ira is of little consequence i know your character ira better than you know it yourself honest sincere impetuous yet meek and candid i can conceive how far you may be driven by the strength of passion how far deluded by the well intended but wrong headed advice of friendship do you love and yet think to forget one by mixing with the world of business impossible personal presence is not necessary to inspire or continue love we love those whom we have never seen or from whom we are removed by absence the characters of the great and the good picture to us ideas of beauty and beauty is the cause of love how are we struck with the awful virtue of a brutus or a cato how delighted with the more gentle more amiable graces of a scipio how do we exult in the honest heart and unambitious mind of a cincinnatus a la fayette and a washington to come up to our times still nearer how are our breasts warmed with sympathetick benevolence at the name of howard do we not figure to ourselves in the solemnity of sacred anticipation the son of heaven seated at the right of the throne of grace extending the hand of welcome to the disciple of charity and pronouncing with the voice of applause i was in prison and you came unto me we love those whom we have not seen because we entertain in our hearts an idea of beauty caused by their virtues surely therefore if you are possessed of such an idea it will follow you to the uttermost parts of the earth haunted continually with the ideal presence of the beloved object you will change your climate but not your mind remembering me is the retrospect painful matters it in what place you take this retrospect better be here though surrounded with disappointment and solemn thought than among strangers let the mind be employed but do not go ira perceived in the argument of isabella that sublime which not only persuades but transports he owned
a word not used by any english prose writer of eminence until the reign of george the third nor ever introduced into a serious poem until adopted by cowper a word which if we may judge of adjectives as we do of men by their associates shows the baseness of its origin by the company it keeps being generally coupled with fellow a term i conceive of no respect except in courts and colleges englishmen from the peer to the peasant cannot converse ten minutes without introducing this pert adjunct the english do not however use it in the same sense we do in new england where we apply it to personal grace and call a trim well built young man clever which signification is sanctioned by bailey s and the elder english dictionaries nor do they use it in our secondary sense when applying it to the qualities of the mind we intend by it good humoured they use it to signify skilful adroit and the man who breaks a dwelling house a prison or a neck adroitly is clever i heard a reverend prebend in company with several clergymen of the episcopal church after having magnified the genius of the prelate pronounce the archbishop of canterbury a very clever fellow a native of england may be distinguished as readily by the frequent use of the adjective clever as the native of new england by that of the verb guess it was not until i had been some months in london that i discovered how often i exposed myself to ridicule by the repeated use of this verb my new friend b of the inner temple who has a profound knowledge of every subject but the law as he is one of those assiduous benchers described by pope who pens a sonnet when he should engross pointed out to me this provincialism as he styled it what is the reason he inquired that you new englandmen are always guessing i replied coolly because we imagine it makes us appear very clever fellows now here to my astonishment b was in the same predicament as myself although he had repeated clever and clever fellow perhaps twenty times in this interview he had not noticed it he was a gentleman of too refined a taste to advocate this alsatia term but would hardly be persuaded of its exuberant use until i had drawn his attention to it in conversation with several of his countrymen and was at length obliged to send him half a sheet of extracts in prose and verse to convince him of its absurd recurrence in the modern english fine writing but b is really a clever fellow learned and candid terms seldom united by a london copula and we agreed to assist each other in devesting our style of these silly colloquisms soon after b said to me with earnestness now you have read boswell you must acknowledge dr johnson to have been a very clever fellow i guess he was i replied if however i should be requested to note some shibboleth to distinguish an old from a new englandman it would not belike the israelites in pronunciation nor yet in expression or accent not in words but in mode an englishman puts and answers a question directly a new englandman puts his questions circuitously and ways answers a question by asking another i am indebted in some measure to b for this distinction who in early life spent a winter in hartford connecticut but which your own observations even in boston will abundantly confirm when my friend the templar first noticed this local peculiarity i was inclined to dispute its universality among us b offered to risk the decision of our dispute upon the reply of the first new englandman we should chance to accost and as an englishman who is opposed to you in argument always has abet or a blow at your service he offered a small wager that he would propose a direct question to him and the yankey should reply by asking another we were strolling in st james s park and who should approach very opportunely butcharles of salem after the first salutations b said pray mr what time of the day is it by your watch why i ca nt say what o clock is it by yours this was followed by a hearty laugh but when the affair was explained to charles he insisted it was merely fortuitous and might not happen again in a thousand instances and finally when b in the pride of victory offered to double the bet and repeat the experiment he took him up b said select your man but here comes your countryman dr you will allow him to be as correct a speaker as any in new england all shall be fair i will put the question in such a way as shall preclude the possibility of his being taken by surprise charles acknowledged dr was the very man he would have selected the doctor by this time joined our party pray doctor said b very deliberately what is the reason you new englandmen always reply to a question by asking another why is that the case sir as you are a very clever fellow and i guess you are wearied by this time i will conclude my letter lest you should not be in a humour to say that s a good one letter xxxiii literary larceny forgery and swindling chatterton ireland and macpherson london my excellent friend in our simple country whenever you hear theft or forgery mentioned you are immediately impressed with the idea of some low fellow stealing a horse or with burroughs issuing his canada bank bills but here in this sublime metropolis where every virtue and every vice is carried to a refined extreme are rogues found who can steal the cardinal virtues and forge counterfeit immortality horace might boast that his name was too
delivered a package of letters to my uncle from my father the carriage with one servant the driver had returned from the chesapeak to connecticut my father had but one brother and two sisters of which my uncle here is the youngest one of my aunts the old maid who was my protectress at the old mansion you have seen at my father s the other was the mother of alfred she married very young to a gentleman in hartford of the name of wilmot who fell before the walls of louisburg in the old french war my aunt did not long survive him her health which had been for some time declining received so serious a shock by this catastrophe that she died a few months after the melancholy tidings arrived leaving alfred their only child then an infant to the protection of his relations who as soon as he arrived at a suitable age placed him at school my grandfather who had the principal management of mr wilmot s estate sent my uncle who was then young and unmarried to hartford for the purpose of transacting the necessary business here he became acquainted with a young lady eminent for beauty and loveliness but without fortune the daughter of a poor mechanic as soon as my grandfather was informed of this attachment he in a very peremptory manner ordered my uncle to break off the connection on pain of his highest displeasure but such is the force of early impressions melissa sighed that my uncle found it impossible to submit to these firm injunctions a clandestine marriage ensued and my grandfather s maledictions in consequence the union was however soon dissolved my uncle s wife died in about twelve months after their marriage and soon after the birth of the first child which was a daughter inconsolable and comfortless my uncle put the child out to nurse and travelled to the south after wandering about for some time he took up his residence in charleston where he amassed a splendid fortune he finally married to an amiable and respectable woman whose tenderness though it did not entirely remove yet greatly alleviated the pangs of early sorrow and this added to the little blandishments of a young family fixed him in a state of more contentedness than he once ever expected to see his daughter by his first wife when she became of proper age was sent to a respectable boarding school in boston where she remained until within about two years before i came here alfred was educated at harvard college as soon as he had graduated he came here on my uncle s request and has since remained in his family soon after i arrived here my uncle came into my chamber one day melissa said he i find by your father s letters that he considers you to have formed an improper connection i wish you to give me a true statement of the matter and if any thing can be done to reconcile you to your father you may depend upon my assistance i have seen some troubles in this way myself in my early days perhaps my counsel may be of some service i immediately gave a correct account of every particular circumstance from the time of my first acquaintance with you until my arrival at this house he sat some time silent and then told me that my father he believed had drawn the worst side of the picture and that he had urged him to exert every means in his power to reclaim me to obedience that beauman was to follow me in a few months and that if i still refused to yield him my hand my father positively and solemnly declared that he would discard me forever and strenuously enjoined it upon him to do the same i well know my brother s temper continued my uncle the case is difficult but something must be done i will immediately write to your father desiring him not to proceed too rashly in the mean time we must consider what measures to pursue you must not my niece you must not be sacrificed so saying he left me highly consoled that instead of a tyrant i had found a friend in my new protector alfred was made acquainted with the affair and many were the plans projected for my benefit and abandoned as indefeasible till an event happened which called forth all the fortitude of my uncle to support it and operated in the end to free me from persecution my uncle s daughter by his first wife was of a very delicate and sickly constitution and her health evidently decreasing after she came to this place she was sent to a village on one of the high hills of pedee where she remained a considerable time she then went to one of the inland towns in north carolina from whence she had but just returned with alfred when i arrived afterwards i accompanied her to georgetown and other places attended by her father so that she was little more known in charleston than myself but all answered no purpose to the restoration of her health a confirmed hectic carried her off in the bloom of youth i was but a few months older than she her name was melissa a name which a pious grandmother had borne and was therefore retained in the family our similarity of age and in some measure of appearance our being so little known in charleston and our names being the same suggested to alfred the idea of imposing on my father by passing off my cousin s death as my own this would at least deter beauman from prosecuting his intended journey to charleston it would also give time for farther deliberation and might so operate on my father s feelings as to soften that obduracy of temper which deeply disquieted himself and others and thus
with a man who had given her such evident proofs of indifference and selfishness but i tremble for her she knows not the world into which she is about to plunge open sincere and without disguise herself she suspects not deceit in others this is a disposition most liable to imposition of any in the world and where joined to great sensibility is the source of undescribable anguish to the possessor i have made some particular inquiries concerning this mrs bellamy with whom sarah is about to embark for an another kingdom i cannot reconcile the idea to myself that a tract of ocean will divide us that in distress or sickness i cannot fly to her that contrary winds may detain her letters even should she write on all occasions but even this she will not promise i will inform you of my health said she but i shall not plague you with all the little cross incidents which may occur while i am acting in my double capacity of humble toad eater to grandmamma and madam governante to little darling you flattered me in your last with the hope of my seeing you in london it will i assure you be a very high gratification but as you mention january for the time of your proposed visit i fear sarah will long ere that have been the inhabitant of our sister island for some weeks as she thinks of departing the latter end of october anne letter xx sarah to anne london jan a most delectable voyage and journey i have had bad weather bad accommodations in the packet bad roads and bad tempered folks to deal with now is not this a bad beginning well there is an old adage which says a good beginning often makes a bad ending and why not vice versa we were six days crossing the channel the wind blew tempestuously and two or three times i thought we should have been obliged to revisit the coast of wales whether we chose it or not and that not in the pleasantest manner imaginable however here we are all difficulties of wind and weather over quietly set down in a very respectable lodging in one of the most public streets in dublin this mrs bellamy is a very different woman on this side st george s channel to what she was on the other and to deal plainly had i known as much before i left england as i do now i should never have thrown myself on her protection but as i am here i will remain a few months i have no great prediliction for another voyage though ever so short during the season when the winds let loose lash the mad billows until they foam and rise threatening even heaven itself indeed my dear there is no scene that ever i witnessed before to be compared to the sublimely terrific grandeur of a storm at sea the horizon contracted by the black impending clouds the angry scud flitting with rapidity through the sky the liquid mountains rising to the topmast heads and from their summit pouring with tremendous roar the white torrent that as it falls threatens to whelm in its abyss the fragile bark as the gloom of night approaches to see on the leeward quarter the black coast o er hung with precipices and fenced around with rocks over which the rude surge incessant breaks to hear the wind howl through the rigging of the laboring vessel which scarce can bear the smallest spread of sail then to reflect that perhaps before the morn returns the vessel crew all all may be enshrouded in a watery tomb no one can have an idea of the sensation that must at such a period prevade the mind even of the most thoughtless unless they have themselves been present at such a scene and to me it seems an impossibility that any one who had once been in such a situation could ever disbelieve the existence of a god great wise powerful and merciful who that has once contemplated his wisdom and his power on the world of waters would wish to disbelieve or for one single moment encourage a doubt but i beg your pardon anne that after having got you safe to dublin i have hurried you back to make you pass a stormy night at sea with a dangerous coast on your lee but as you have escaped shipwreck you may even come quietly again to dublin and setting down by my elbow in a little room up two pair of stairs which is but superior to a closet in a very small degree the furniture of which consists of a half tester bed a deal table a small iron grate that will hold a handful of fire and two rush bottom chairs now is not the apartment most elegant come sit down and be quiet and i will tell you all about madam bellamy and her fair daughter madam o donnel and her sweet pretty peevish petulant perverse grand daughter miss caroline o donnel the old dame does not want ideas in her head nor language to express those ideas but she is one of the most changeable capricious beings that nature ever formed her manners have been formed upon the scale of high life and she certainly has in early days sacrificed to the graces for even now she can converse with condescending affability every word accompanied by a fassinating smile she can be cheerful even to volability persuasion will hang upon her tongue and the genius of taste wit and elegance preside in her apartment but see her two hours after you will not know her for the same woman her brow will lour her large black eyes will flash malignity the demon of spite and slander take possession of her tongue and her language will be such as almost the lowest female would blush
should sternly insist that the work has none of the three great requisites a beginning a middle and an end the author has obligingly fixed the beginning at the first page and the end at the last leaving every one to place the middle where it best suits him or the learned critic may make a beginning by reading only a few pages and an end by frowning the whole work at once into oblivion whereby two out of the three requisites will certainly be produced in short the learned author in imitation of high authorities solicits the indulgence of the public with regard to the appearance of our common uncle sam although he is old enough to be very whimsical he is like the author a green character on the stage he will occasionally make his appearance on various parts of it bouncing like a sturgeon sinking out of sight and soon after thundering out at a distant part now if any one should be so impertinent as to enquire how he travelled some of our novel readers would be the most proper persons to solve the difficulty it will be ob served that another hand besides the professed author s has fingered occasionally in the work this with the discerning will form no objection of this character will be the next chapter the learned ancestors of mine uncle zachary are well known to the hebrew public and although the author at first resolved to have no mosaic work in the splendid structure yet it occurred to him that variety ever has its attractions and it is well known that stanhold and hopkin s translated psalms in company having said this the author submits himself to the acutely censorious allowing them to use the birchen rod whenever they can find him chapter ii some account of thomas the magician and it came to pass fell out or happened somewhat before the time at which our history begins that there arose a mighty man in the land called thomas the magician on account of his great skill and cunning in dark and mysterious projects this man when in his full strength was a mighty man of valor and withal very tender hearted insomuch that in the first notable quarrel between john bull and uncle sam he betook himself to a huge cavern lest his great strength and valor might do overmuch violence to his enemies here he studied magic necromancy and all the curious arts that serve to make a man great in the eyes of the multitude this thomas was moreover of a religious turn of mind for whereas uncle sam acknowledged only one god thomas professed to believe in twenty or none as occasion required whence it came to pass that the multitude for the space of many years cried out great is thomas the magician and it fell out that in process of time thomas fixed his eye on the chief steward ship for thus he reasoned with himself behold now the multitude of the people crieth after me and although george who is now chief steward is greatly beloved by the people yet he now governeth the household of samuel by a new covenant unto which divers of them have not willingly consented therefore i will listen diligently and whensoever t hear a murmuring will say unto the people would it not have been better thus behold did i not forewarn thee and so it came to pass that he began to take the servants by the hand and say unto them o that i were made judge in the land that any man having a matter should come to me and i would do him justice nevertheless the people were not minded to hearken to him for this time so that john became chief steward yet during the stewardship of john which was fifty and two moons thomas ceased not to vex the understanding of the multitude and to cause them to find much fault with the conduct of john and the wife of samuel and caused many grievous and sore complaints to be brought against them behold said thomas how mine uncle samuel hath fought in times past against john bull and hath prevailed nevertheless he oweth at this time many talents of silver yet john ceaseth not to build ships and to have bowmen and spearmen not a few and to lay many grievous burthens on the people and crieth out the philistines when no enemy is near and the whole land is in peace and see ye not this woman in whom the heart of mine uncle samuel is bound up how she walketh in the pride of her imagination and hath bought many costly ornaments of silk and of purple and delighteth in hoods and ear rings and bracelets and nose jewels and saith i sit a queen moreover she whispereth in secret and backbiteth and mocketh at all who walk not in her ways and approve not of her evil doings and thus did thomas stir up the minds of the people against john and they waxed wroth against john and they thrust him out of the stewardship and said unto thomas reign thou over us and unto samuel they said the counsel of this woman is not good for she wasteth thy substance lo now put her away and take unto thee the damsel which thomas hath provided for he hath proved her so samuel hearkened unto the people and put away his wife and the thing grieved george sore howbeit he put her away and took the damsel even the woman which thomas had appointed and he went in unto her and she became his wife now thomas had instructed her aforetime and said whenever it shall come to pass that thou shalt rule in the house of samuel whatsoever i shall bid you to do that shalt thou do without gainsaying and she said i will moreover
endangers that is an enemy not to me but to my country not your enemy major asked fleming in a tone of surprize no sir i never had an enemy i lost a hand not in fighting for myself but in defending my country though my sword has tasted blood my feelings and passions had no agency in the act i felt that i was engaged in a duty similar to that in which we are engaged in fighting and subduing our internal spiritual enemies our evil propensities which we are commanded to overcome and destroy though dearer to us than life for as we do the one for the welfare and happiness of the country which protects us so we perform the other for the promotion and extension of our redeemer s kingdom and our share of felicity in each is always proportionate to the uses we perform for both a very strange discrimination and most singular comparison was fleming s remark pray friend enquired brown to what religious sect dost thou belong willoughby again smiled to none sir in religion as in politics i know but one party i am a christian and know of no name under heaven by which man can be saved but that of jesus christ our creator and redeemer but this is again flying from the subject said fleming you say sir that you are an american so are we all by birth or adoption but which of the two administrations do you prefer the federal or republican mr fleming you must consider the question of considerable importance by the earnestness with which you urge it but i consider it of no importance whatever the last fifteen years of my life has been passed in a wilderness i have taken no part in the various questions of policy which have arisen in that period from the loop holes of retreat i have indeed occasionally peeped at mankind and like the poet whose expression i use have sighed for their follies and crimes i have seen two great political parties by turns possess the ascendency and hold the reins of government i entirely approve of neither i have found much to commend but still more to condemn in the measures of both self love and the love of dominion have in my opinion influenced them all and this will continue to be the case until human nature is renovated a singular politician exclaimed fleming as he rose to depart but we will renew the subject at another time mr brown i shall expect you to tea a still more singular christian said the quaker with a smile pray tell me friend how dost thou reconcile the doctrines of christ for whom thou appearest to have a great reverence with thy notions of patriotism and military duties my dear sir replied willoughby there is not a man on earth even the most zealous of your sect that is more fully convinced than i am that all the wars which have ever desolated this fair globe of earth have originated from men s lusts which war in the members the lust of the flesh the lust of the eye and the pride of life are the fuel which evil spirits by blasts from hell too often kindle to an infernal blaze in the hearts of the children of men how then canst thou conscientiously engage in them why sir in my opinion answered the major the true merits of the question must rest upon this point is it lawful to resist the unjust aggressions of wicked men in their mercenary or ambitious attempts to rob us of those inestimable blessings and unalienable rights which nature or rather nature s god has bestowed upon us in order to promote our happiness and the happiness of our posterity trust to god alone answered the quaker and he will protect them for us pardon me replied willoughby would not that be like casting ourselves from the pinnacle of solomon s temple and trusting to god to give his angels charge to bear us up this would be tempting god as the devil wished our saviour to tempt him when he made that proposition not knowing that he was addressing god himself but permit me to illustrate my first position that infernal spirits can only effect their evil designs in this world through the medium or agency of such unhappy mortals as have previously been brought under their wicked influence by passive compliance is a truth which no christian i presume will deny and hence by a transposition as logical as any in algebra the question before us when stripped of all external terms and forms appears to be this is it lawful upon gospel principles to arrest or oppose the movements of infernal spirits in attempting to deprive us of those blessings which a bountiful and gracious providence has bestowed upon us as men or as christians i would answer in the negative said the quaker let every meek just and pious man so oppressed plead rebuke and remonstrate against the impropriety impolicy and injustice of such offenders and to convince and turn the current of public opinion against them which would as it became general sweep gradually their oppressors into the fathomless ocean religion is supernatural and checks self defence but self defence sir is the first law of nature it is a principle implanted in us by god for the preservation of our lives it is this principle which prompts us to extend our hand when falling or to guard off an impending blow or if that is out of our power to disable the hand which is giving it i still think sir that it would be tempting the almighty to remain in either case perfectly passive and trust to him for protection i will grant replied brown that self defence is the first law of nature but those who are united to that which is
of considerable value gudeman she said to ochiltree as ye wad e er deserve mercy ye maun gang my errand to the house of glenallan and ask for the earl the earl of glenallan cummer ou he winna see ony o the gentles o the country and what likelihood is there that he wad see the like o an auld gaberlunzie gang your ways and try and tell him that elspeth o the craigburnfoot he ll mind me best by that name maun see him or she be relieved frae her lang pilgrimage and that she sends him that ring in token of the business she wad speak o ochiltree looked on the ring with some admiration of its apparent value and then carefully replacing it in the box and wrapping it in an old ragged handkerchief he deposited the token in his bosom weel gudewife he said i se do your bidding or it s no be my fault but surely there was never sic a braw propine as this sent to a yerl by an auld fishwife and through the hands of a gaberlunzie beggar with this reflection edie took up his pike staff put on his broad brimmed bonnet and set forth upon his pilgrimage the old woman remained for some time standing in a fixed posture her eyes directed to the door through which her ambassador had departed the appearance of excitation which the conversation had occasioned gradually left her features she sank down upon her accustomed seat and resumed her mechanical labour of the distaff and spindle with her wonted air of apathy edie ochiltree meanwhile advanced on his journey the distance to glenallan was ten miles a march which the old soldier accomplished in about four hours with the curiosity belonging to his idle trade and animated character he tortured himself the whole way to consider what could be the meaning of this mysterious errand with which he was entrusted or what connection the proud wealthy and powerful earl of glenallan could have with the crimes or penitence of an old doting woman whose rank in life did not greatly exceed that of her messenger he endeavoured to call to memory all that he had ever known or heard of the glenallan family yet having done so remained altogether unable to form a conjecture on the subject he knew that the whole extensive estate of this ancient and powerful family had descended to the countess lately deceased who inherited in a most remarkable degree the stern fierce and unbending character which had distinguished the house of glenallan since they first figured in scottish annals like the rest of her ancestors she adhered zealously to the roman catholic faith and was married to an english gentleman of the same communion and of large fortune who did not survive their union two years the countess was therefore left an early widow with the uncontrolled management of the large estates of her two sons the elder lord geraldin who was to succeed to the title and fortune of glenallan was totally dependent on his mother during her life the second when he came of age assumed the name and arms of his father and took possession of his estate according to the provisions of the countess s marriage settlement after this period he chiefly resided in england and paid very few and brief visits to his mother and brother and these at length were altogether dispensed with in consequence of his becoming a convert to the reformed religion but even before this mortal offence was given to its mistress his residence at glenallan offered few inducements to a gay young man like edward geraldin neville though its gloom and seclusion seemed to suit the retired and melancholy habits of his elder brother lord geraldin in the outset of life had been a young man of accomplishment and hopes those who knew him upon his travels entertained the highest expectations of his future career but such fair dawns are often strangely overcast the young nobleman returned to scotland and after living about a year in his mother s society at glenallan house he seemed to have adopted all the stern gloom and melancholy of her character excluded from politics by the incapacities attached to those of his religion and from all lighter avocationas by choice lord geraldin led a life of the strictest retirement his ordinary society was composed of the clergyman of his communion who occasionally visited his mansion and very rarely upon stated occasions of high festival one or two families who still professed the catholic religion were formally entertained at glenallan house but this was all their heretic neighbours knew nothing of the family whatever and even the catholics saw little more than the sumptuous entertainment and solemn parade which was exhibited on those formal occasions from which all returned without knowing whether most to wonder at the stern and stately demeanour of the countess or the deep and gloomy dejection which never ceased for a moment to cloud the features of her son the late event had put him in possession of his fortune and title and the neighbourhood had already begun to conjecture whether gaiety would revive with independence when those who had some occasional acquaintance with the interior of the family spread abroad a report that the earl s constitution was undermined by religious austerities and that in all probability he would soon follow his mother to the grave this event was the more probable as his brother had died of a lingering complaint which in the latter years of his life had affected at once his frame and his spirits so that heralds and genealogists were already looking back into their records to discover the heir of this ill fated family and lawyers were talking with gleesome anticipation of the probability of a great glenallan cause as edie ochiltree approached the front of glenallan house an ancient building of great extent
of our birth if we do not shake off the national prejudices as we would the local superstitions of the old world but above all let us not be influenced by any angry feelings so far as to shut our eyes to the perception of what is really excellent and amiable in the english character we are a young people necessarily an imitative one and must take our examples and models in a great degree from the existing nations of europe there is no country more worthy of our study than england the spirit of her constitution is most analogous to ours the manners of her people their intellectual activity their freedom of opinion their habits of thinking on those subjects which concern the dearest interests and most sacred charities of private life are all congenial to the american character and in fact are all intrinsically excellent for it is in the moral feeling of the people that the deep foundations of british prosperity are laid and however the superstructure may be timeworn or overrun by abuses there must be something solid in the basis admirable in the materials and stable in the structure of an edifice that so long has towered unshaken amidst the tempests of the world let it be the pride of our writers therefore discarding all feelings of irritation and disdaining to retaliate the illiberality of british authors to speak of the english nation without prejudice and with determined candor while they rebuke the indiscriminating bigotry with which some of our countrymen admire and imitate every thing english merely because it is english let them frankly point out what is really worthy of approbation we may thus place england before us as a perpetual volume of reference wherein are recorded sound deductions from ages of experience and while we avoid the errors and absurdities which may have crept into the page we may draw thence golden maxims of practical wisdom wherewith to strengthen and to embellish our national character rural life in england oh friendly to the best pursuits of man friendly to thought to virtue and to peace domestic life in rural pleasures past cowper the stranger who would form a correct opinion of the english character must not confine his observations to the metropolis he must go forth into the country he must sojourn in villages and hamlets he must visit castles villas farm houses cottages he must wander through parks and gardens along hedges and green lanes he must loiter about country churches attend wakes and fairs and other rural festivals and cope with the people in all their conditions and all their habits and humors in some countries the large cities absorb the wealth and fashion of the nation they are the only fixed abodes of elegant and intelligent society and the country is inhabited almost entirely by boorish peasantry in england on the contrary the metropolis is a mere gathering place or general rendezvous of the polite classes where they devote a small portion of the year to a hurry of gayety and dissipation and having indulged this kind of carnival return again to the apparently more congenial habits of rural life the various orders of society are therefore diffused over the whole surface of the kingdom and the more retired neighborhoods afford specimens of the different ranks the english in fact are strongly gifted with the rural feeling they possess a quick sensibility to the beauties of nature and a keen relish for the pleasures and employments of the country this passion seems inherent in them even the inhabitants of cities born and brought up among brick walls and bustling streets enter with facility into rural habits and evince a tact for rural occupation the merchant has his snug retreat in the vicinity of the metropolis where he often displays as much pride and zeal in the cultivation of his flower garden and the maturing of his fruits as he does in the conduct of his business and the success of a commercial enterprise even those less fortunate individuals who are doomed to pass their lives in the midst of din and traffic contrive to have something that shall remind them of the green aspect of nature in the most dark and dingy quarters of the city the drawing room window resembles frequently a bank of flowers every spot capable of vegetation has its grass plot and flower bed and every square its mimic park laid out with picturesque taste and gleaming with refreshing verdure those who see the englishman only in town are apt to form an unfavorable opinion of his social character he is either absorbed in business or distracted by the thousand engagements that dissipate time thought and feeling in this huge metropolis he has therefore too commonly a look of hurry and abstraction wherever he happens to be he is on the point of going somewhere else at the moment he is talking on one subject his mind is wandering to another and while paying a friendly visit he is calculating how he shall economize time so as to pay the other visits allotted to the morning an immense metropolis like london is calculated to make men selfish and uninteresting in their casual and transient meetings they can but deal briefly in commonplaces they present but the cold superfices of character its rich and genial qualities have no time to be warmed into a flow it is in the country that the englishman gives scope to his natural feelings he breaks loose gladly from the cold formalities and negative civilities of town throws off his habits of shy reserve and becomes joyous and free hearted he manages to collect round him all the conveniences and elegancies of polite life and to banish its restraints his country seat abounds with every requisite either for studious retirement tasteful gratification or rural exercise books paintings music horses dogs and sporting implements of all kinds are at hand he puts
holy office the fourth performer in this trial of memories was an ancient lady gaily dressed and intently eager on the game between her and the young man was a large pile of guineas which appeared to be her exclusive property from which she repeatedly during the play tendered one to his acceptance on the event of a hand or a trick and to which she seldom failed from inadvertence to add his mite contributing to accumulate the pile two double and the rub my dear doctor exclaimed the senior lady in triumph sir william you owe me ten the money was paid as easily as it had been won and the dowager proceeded to settle some bets with her female antagonist two more i fancy ma am said she closely scanning the contributions of the maiden i believe it is right my lady was the answer with a look that said pretty plainly that or nothing i beg pardon my dear here are but four and you remember two on the corner and four on the points doctor i will trouble you for a couple of guineas from miss wigram s store i am in haste to get to the countess s route the doctor was coolly helping himself from the said store under the watchful eyes of its owner and secretly exulting in his own judgment in requiring the stakes when the maiden replied in great warmth your ladyship forgets the two you lost to me at mrs howard s it must be a mistake my dear i always pay as i lose cried the dowager with great spirit stretching over the table and helping herself to the disputed money mr benfield and emily had stood silent spectators of the whole scene the latter in astonishment to meet such manners in such society and the former under feelings it would have been difficult to describe for in the face of the dowager which was inflamed partly from passion and more from high living he recognised the remains of his lady juliana now the dowager viscountess haverford emmy dear said the old man with a heavy drawn sigh as if awaking from a long and troubled dream we will go the phantom of forty years had vanished before the truth and the fancies of retirement simplicity and a diseased imagination yielded to the influence of life and common sense chapter xl with harriet now closely connected with them by marriage as well as attachment the baronet s family maintained a most friendly intercourse and mrs wilson and emily a prodigious favorite with her new cousin consented to pass a day soberly with her during an excursion of her husband to windsor on business connected with his station they had accordingly driven round to an early breakfast and chatterton after politely regretting his loss and thanking them for their consideration for his wife made his bow lady harriet denbigh had brought the baron a very substantial addition to his fortune and as his sisters were both provided for by ample settlements the pecuniary distresses which had existed a twelvemonth before had been entirely removed chatterton s income was now large his demands upon it small and he kept up an establishment in proportion to the rank of both husband and wife mrs wilson cried the hostess twirling her cup as she followed with her eyes the retreating figure of her husband at the door i am about to take up the trade of miss harris and become a match maker not on your own behalf so soon surely rejoined the widow oh no my fortune is made for life or not at all continued the other gaily but in behalf of our little friend emily here me cried emily starting from a reverie in which the prospect of happiness to lady laura was the subject you are very good harriet for whom do you intend me whom who is good enough for you but my cousin pendennyss ah she cried laughing as she caught emily by the hand derwent and myself both settled the matter long since and i know you will yield when you come to know him the duke cried the other with a surprise and innocence that immediately brought a blush of the brightest vermillion into her face yes the duke said lady chatterton you may think it odd for a discarded lover to dispose of his mistress so soon but both our hearts are set upon it the earl arrived last night and this day he and his sister dine with us in a sober way now my dear madam turning to mrs wilson have i not prepared an agreeable surprise for you surprise indeed said the widow excessively gratified at the probable termination to her anxieties for this meeting but where are they from from northamptonshire where the earl has already purchased a residence i understand and in your neighborhood too so you perceive he at least begins to think of the thing a certain evidence truly cried emily his having purchased the house but was he without a residence that he bought the deanery oh no he has a palace in town and three seats in the country but none in northamptonshire but this said the lady with a laugh to own the truth he did offer to let george denbigh have it for the next summer but the colonel chose to be nearer eltringham and i take it it was only a ruse in the earl to cloak his own designs you may depend upon it we trumpeted your praises to him incessantly in westmoreland and is colonel denbigh in town said mrs wilson stealing an anxious glance towards her niece who in spite of all her efforts sensibly changed color oh yes and laura is as happy as happy as myself said lady chatterton with a glow on her cheeks as she attended to the request of her housekeeper and left the
or firmness enough to contemplate our approaching destiny without the cheering of some more determined countenance than their own the wind was strong all day and the sea ran very high our boat taking in water from her leaks continually so that we were obliged to keep one man constantly bailing during the night the weather became extremely rugged and the sea every now and then broke over us by agreement we were divided into two watches one of which was to be constantly awake and doing the labours of the boat such as bailing setting taking in and trimming the sails we kept our course very well together during this night and had many opportunities of conversation with the men in the other boats wherein the means and prospects of our deliverance were variously considered it appeared from the opinions of all that we had most to hope for in the meeting with some vessel and most probably some whale ship the great majority of whom in those seas we imagined were cruising about the latitude we were then steering for but this was only a hope the realization of which did not in any degree depend on our own exertions but on chance alone it was not therefore considered prudent by going out of our course with the prospect of meeting them to lose sight for one moment of the strong probabilities which under divine providence there were of our reaching land by the route we had prescribed to ourselves as that depended most especially on a reasonable calculation and on our own labours we conceived that our provision and water on a small allowance would last us sixty days that with the trade wind on the course we were then lying we should be able to average the distance of a degree a day which in days would enable us to attain the region of the variable winds and then in thirty more at the very utmost should there by any favour in the elements we might reach the coast with these considerations we commenced our voyage the total failure of all which and the subsequent dismal distress and suffering by which we were overtaken will be shown in the sequel our allowance of provision at first consisted of bread one biscuit weighing about one pound three ounces and half a pint of water a day for each man this small quantity less than one third which is required by an ordinary person small as it was we however took without murmuring and on many an occasion afterwards blest god that even this pittance was allowed to us in our misery the darkness of another night overtook us and after having for the first time partook of our allowance of bread and water we laid our weary bodies down in the boat and endeavoured to get some repose nature became at last worn out with the watchings and anxieties of the two preceding nights and sleep came insensibly upon us no dreams could break the strong fastenings of forgetfulness in which the mind was then locked up but for my own part my thoughts so haunted me that this luxury was yet a stranger to my eyes every recollection was still fresh before me and i enjoyed but a few short and unsatisfactory slumbers caught in the intervals between my hopes and my fears the dark ocean and swelling waters were nothing the fears of being swallowed up by some dreadful tempest or dashed upon hidden rocks with all the other ordinary subjects of fearful contemplation seemed scarcely entitled to a moment s thought the dismal looking wreck and the horrid aspect and revenge of the whale wholly engrossed my reflections until day again made its appearance november rd in my chest which i was fortunate enough to preserve i had several small articles which we found of great service to us among the rest some eight or ten sheets of writing paper a lead pencil a suit of clothes three small fish hooks a jack knife besides other useful purposes served us as a razor it was with much difficulty however that i could keep any sort of record owing to the incessant rocking and unsteadiness of the boat and the continual dashing of the spray of the sea over us the boat contained in addition to the articles enumerated a lantern tinderbox and two or three candles which belonged to her and with which they are kept always supplied while engaged in taking whale in addition to all which the captain had saved a musket two pistols and a canister containing about two pounds of gunpowder the latter he distributed in equal proportions between the three boats and gave the second mate and myself each a pistol when morning came we found ourselves quite near together and the wind had considerably increased since the day before we were consequently obliged to reef our sales and although we did not apprehend any very great danger from the then violence of the wind yet it grew to be very uncomfortable in the boats from the repeated dashing of the waves that kept our bodies constantly wet with the salt spray we however stood along our course until twelve o clock when we got an observation as well as we were able to obtain one while the water flew all over us and the sea kept the boat extremely unsteady we found ourselves this day in latitude s having repassed the equator we abandoned the idea altogether of keeping any correct longitudinal reckoning having no glass nor log line the wind moderated in the course of the afternoon a little but at night came on to blow again almost a gale we began now to tremble for our little barque she was so ill calculated in point of strength to withstand the racking of the sea while it required the constant labours of one man to keep her
giving her the picturesque and and beautiful aspect of a greek girl and now she would toss it wildly over her temples and bosom till she resembled some terrified bacchante his own daughters sat laughing and pouting by her side occasionally interfering and squabbling about the gracefulness and effect of this cluster or that waving luxuriant mass that flowed as if it were liquid silk over her shoulders he laid his parental hand upon loena s head and put his lips to her forehead she coloured but seized his hand and blessed him with that fervour that innocent and natural fervour which is not to be counterfeited or affected her emotion choked her the conversation so long dreaded was soon began and the countenances of all grew more and more serious mournful sad as he proceeded until there was not a dry eye in the room a frigate was to sail the same evening for calaisharold was to depart in her harold faintly articulated the gasping girl shut her eyes harold echoed all the others the word died away on their lips they all clung to poor loena with hands and mouths as she buried her face in the lap of the countess a sad presentiment sat heavily upon her heart so much admonition so much advice so much gentle insinuation so many new feelings and thoughts about propriety conjured up it could not be for slight purposes yet what was she to fear they were to go together together were they oh yes but then he said harold harold only i will go she exclaimed starting upon her feet forgetful of their presence i will go with him the wide world over let me see who shall dare to oppose me harold come thou to my defence they had been watching every movement and devandreueil now left the room saying to his wife significantly that he left loena to her care oh said the countess after a few moments of mournful silence while the dim eyes of the indian girl were searching out the mystery of this behaviour with a look unutterable expostulation oh as if she that moment recollected herself oh how long is it my dear she stopped a moment for she found it exceedingly difficult to make herself intelligible to loena whose early lessons in french were but just beginning to revive besides she was startled at her own abruptness and inwardly awed at the calm melancholy the beautiful self possession that arose gradually upon the youthful countenance before her as if to rebuke all particular inquiry so much for her lessons in propriety but her lip trembled and she pressed the hand of the countess and put her mouth meekly upon the blue veins as if conscious that this was not the time for the princess to be seen no but for the woman the tender and impassioned woman alone a tear fell upon the hand she stooped with her luxuriant tresses and would have wiped it away but her mother fur thrice had the lady called her daughter and her heart earned to show its sensibility to the endearing relationship her mother forbad it and dismissed the girl and children with her hand i am abrupt love she said i know that i am but thy frank nature is accustomed to that thou art a woman a young inexperienced and enthusiastick woman i tremble for thee here thou hast come a stranger my child an innocent unfriended unsupported helpless stranger among strangers loena s eyes overflowed with no brother no lather no sister not even one of thy nation loena attempted to speak what sayest thou lover nay do not weep poor loena sobbed as if her heart would break the countess continued no father no mother oh yes thou hast i will be thy mother my sweet girl wilt thou be my daughter i will o i will faintly whispered the fainting girl bid me as thou wilt i will do thy bidding my mother my dear dear mother the countess embraced her passionately the contact was inconceivably affecting to both loena felt as if her own mother had risen from the grave and the countess as if caressing her youngest born the child of her old age behold them a beautiful woman a french woman a parisienne locked to the bosom of a young american an indian girl brown and sparkling with barbarian ornament locked too as a mother and daughter in overwhelming and inexpressible tenderness it was the union of ministering intelligences the priesthood of loveliness among the oppressors and the oppressed fashion and nature the perfection of art and the simplicity of unadulterate uncontaminate nature my daughter compose thyself continued the countess lean awhile on me the bosom of thy mother why how thy temples throb child and the sweat i declare thy hair is wet on thy forehead with it verily verily but thou art fearfully and wonderfully made we are all so woman is at best but frailly delicately constituted but thou art so in an especial manner more a thing of intellect and nerve and spirit than aught that i know even among women come come cheer up and prepare thyself thy heart too why it is coming through thy side it feels mother as if it would indeed answered the trembling girl as she shook back her redundant hair and looked up in her face with a quivering lip and a pale very pale cheek it feels mother as if it were nothing but ashes o it is dry pulverised there is no moisture in it i would weep but i cannot weep i cannot shed another tear but go on my mother o how it delights me to pronounce the strange word ma mere ma mere i am prepared saying this she arose and sat upright upheld and sustained by her own unconquerable spirit now was to be the trial she was sure of it
said poor lucy i never felt so much for her that s right child now we will go on but first let that tear drop that glistens in the moonbeam fall on the grave it helps to keep the grass green and the dead like to be cried for she added mournfully they now proceeded crazy bet leading the way with long and hasty strides in a diagonal course still ascending the hill till she plunged into a deep wood so richly clothed with foliage as to be impervious to the moon beams and so choaked with underbrush that jane found it very difficult to keep up with her pioneer they soon however emerged into an open space completely surrounded and enclosed by lofty trees crazy bet had not spoken since they began their walk she now stopped and turning abruptly to jane do you know said she who are the worshippers that meet in this temple the spirits that were sometime disobedient but since he went and preached to them they came out from their prison house and worship in the open air and under the light of the blessed heavens it is a beautiful spot said jane i should think all obedient spirits might worship in this temple say you so then worship with me the maniac fell on her knees jane knelt beside her she had caught a spark of her companion s enthusiasm the singularity of her situation the beauty of the night the novelty of the place on which the moon now riding high in the heavens poured a flood of silver light all conspired to give a high tone to her feelings it is not strange she should have thought she never heard any thing so sublime as the prayer of her crazed conductor who raised her arms and poured out her soul in passages of scripture the most sublime and striking woven together by her own glowing language she concluded suddenly and springing on her feet said to jane now follow me fear not and falter not for you know what awaits the fearful and unbelieving jane assured her she had no fear but that of being too late you need not think of that the spirit never quits till i come they now turned into the wood by a narrow pathway whose entrance laid under the shadow of two young beach trees crazy bet paused see ye these child said she pointing to the trees i know two who grew up thus on the same spot of earth so lovingly they grew and she pointed to the interlacing of the branches young and beautiful but the pxe was laid to the root of one and the other and she pressed both her hands on her head and screamed wildly died here a burst of tears afforded her a sudden relief poor broken hearted creature murmured jane no child when she weeps then the band is loosened for added she drawing closer to jane and whispering they put an iron band around her head and when she is in darkness it presses till she thinks she is in the place of the tormenter by the light of the moon it s loosened you cannot see it but it is there always there jane began now to be alarmed at the excitement of bet s imagination and turning from her abruptly entered the path which after they had proceeded a few yards seemed to be leading them into a wild trackless region where are we going bet she exclaimed through a pass child that none knows but the wild bird and the wild woman have you never heard of the caves of the mountain yes replied jane but i had rather not go through them to night cannot we go some other way nay there is no other way follow me and fear not jane had often heard of the pass called the mountain caves and she believed it had only been penetrated by a few rash youths of daring and adventurous spirit she was appalled at the thought of entering it in the dead of night and with such a conductor she paused but she could see no way of escape and summoning all her resolution she followed bet who took no note of her scruples they now entered a defile which apparently had been made by some tremendous convulsion of nature that had rent the mountain asunder and piled rock on rock in the deep abyss the breadth of the passage which was walled in by the perpendicular sides of the mountain was not in any place more than twenty feet and sometimes so narrow that jane thought she might have extended her arms quite across it but she had no leisure for critical accuracy her wayward guide pressed on heedless of the difficulties of the way she would pass between huge rocks that had rolled so near together as to leave but a very narrow passage between them then grasping the tangled roots that projected from the side of the mountain and placing her feet in the fissures of the rocks or in the little channels that had been worn by the continual dropping from the mountain rills she would glide over swiftly and safely as if she had been on the beaten highway they were sometimes compelled in the depths of the caverns to prostrate themselves and creep through narrow apertures between the rocks it was impossible to surmount and jane felt that she was passing over masses of ice the accumulation perhaps of a hundred winters she was fleet and agile and inspired with almost supernatural courage she though a woman naturally born to fears followed on resolutely till they came to an immense rock whose conical and giant form rested on broken masses below that on every side were propping this mighty monarch of the scene for the first time crazy bet seemed to remember she had a
facilitate his passage by enabling him the more easily to drag his body through the only obstacle that perplexed him was a strong iron grating that was fixed over its entrance this he however was determined to overcome by some energetic effort his chief difficulty was in persuading the doctor as to the practicability of the scheme at length when the latter perceived that no reasoning would prevent peter from trying it he determined not to desert him but to assist all he could although he anticipated all the evil consequences of complete failure and detection in pursuance of this resolution having secretly provided a small bag full of provisions and a couple of spades they one dark night about two weeks after the doctor s rescue when all the garrison except the sentinels had gone to sleep scaled the low wooden fence that surrounded the washer woman s yard and commenced their operations by digging a hole close to the grate sufficiently large to admit their entrance as the ground was soft and peter an excellent spadesman this was only the work of about fifteen minutes and into the mud bottomed pit he plunged without hesitation head foremost dragging by means of a strong cord attached to it the bag of provisions after him the doctor had now nothing for it but to follow for the first three or four yards they swam or paddled like ducks in the stagnant water which had here collected to the depth of eight or ten inches on account of some deficiency in its fall towards the creek but this was the easiest part of their progress for during the remainder peter found the passage so small that it required all his perseverance and strength to squeeze himself forward which however he persisted in doing and at last with incredible labour and not without great fatigue and soreness of both flesh and bones he arrived at the open air on the bank of the creek the doctor being a smaller man found less difficulty in passing especially as the efforts of peter had cleared the way for him although enveloped in a complete vesture of mud and dirt our adventurers did not wait to wash themselves in the creek but taking to the woods hastened on as speedily as the darkness and the numerous impediments of the way would permit towards the alleghany river daylight overtook them while yet in the intricacies of the forest when being both hungry and fatigued they thought proper to enjoy some of such fare as their bag afforded and then to repose themselves for a few hours about noon they again proceeded and continued their journey till the evening when resolving not to undergo the fatigue of another night struggling amidst brush wood swamps and fallen timber they selected a place of shelter and by collecting together a quantity of dry leaves made themselves as comfortable a bed as they could on which their fatigue and long wakefulness enabled them to sleep soundly till the morning after three days troublesome journeying in this manner during which they became sometimes afraid of not being on their proper course they arrived at the alleghany river a short distance below its confluence with french creek from thence they kept down the stream of the river for upwards of four days and it was the ninth from their leaving le boeuf before they met with charles as already stated chapter xv survey his front where wisdom sits serene and the bright flashing of his fearless eye that gallant port that majesty of mien which promise deeds of unsurpass d emprise such as to minstrelsy its fondest theme supplies and gains the palm the world may not deny basket of scraps the dearest to each other are often doomed to part it is one of the evils incident to humanity and one from which all the philosophy in the world will not relieve us the best way therefore to meet the evil is to do it courageously and philosophize nothing about it charles adderly on this occasion did so and in consequence he succeeded in separating from maria with a reluctant heart it must be confessed but not with a desponding one his party consisting of himself dr killbreath paddy frazier peter m fall and manhulseh their indian guide commenced their journey on the third day after peter and the doctor had arrived at frazier s besides the horses on which they rode they had along with them three others two of which were laden with paddy s merchandise and the third with provisions and other traveling stores they were of course well armed for in those days no one ever thought of attempting a journey of even a short distance through the wilderness without being properly prepared for both defence and attack on the third day they crossed the chesnut ridge and encamped that night between it and the laurel hill in what is now called ligonier valley as they were about continuing their journey the next morning they were unexpectedly attacked by a small party of otawas whom the french had despatched to scour the country in pursuit of peter and the doctor the savages however had given their fire at too great a distance to do any serious mischief two of their shots feebly pierced through a package of paddy s furs and another slightly wounded one of the horses the rest fell altogether harmless each of our travellers immediately took to a tree and kept up such a well directed fire upon their enemies when any of them dared to appear in sight that the latter thought proper about mid day to withdraw after having lost five or six of their number who were killed on the spot our party then cautiously proceeded onwards keeping on all directions a good look out which obliged them to travel so slowly that they only reached the top of the laurel
a vacant stare some few years afterward during the late war i saw the same man approaching again and i resolved to check his career accordingly i stepped into the middle of the road and stretched wide both my arms and cried stop sir on your peril at this the man said now lightfoot confound the robber at the same time he gave the whip liberally to the flank of his horse which bounded off with such force that it appeared to me two such horses give them a place to stand would overcome any check man could devise an ammunition wagon which had just passed on to baltimore had dropped an eighteen pounder in the road this unlucky ball lay in the way of the horse s heels and the beast with the sagacity of a demon clinched it with of his heels and hurled it behind him i feel dizzy in relating the fact but so nearly did the ball pass my head that the wind thereof blew off my hat and the ball embedded itself in that gate post as you may see if you will cast your eye on the post i have permitted it to remain there in memory of the occurrence as the people of boston i am told preserve the eighteen pounder which is now to be seen half embedded in brattle street church i then took leave of the toll gatherer and promised him if i saw or heard of his gate i would send him notice a strong inclination had possessed me to arrest rugg and search his pockets thinking great discoveries might be made in the examination but what i saw and heard that day convinced me that no human force could detain peter rugg against his consent i therefore determined if i ever saw rugg again to treat him in the gentlest manner in pursuing my way to new york i entered on the turnpike in trenton and when i arrived at new brunswick i perceived the road was newly macadamized the small stones had just been laid thereon as i passed this piece of road i observed that at regular distances of about eight feet the stones were entirely displaced from spots as large as the circumference of a half bushel measure this singular appearance induced me to inquire the cause of it at the turnpike gate sir said the toll gatherer i wonder not at the question but i am unable to give you a satisfactory answer indeed sir i believe i am bewitched and that the turnpike is under a spell of enchantment for what appeared to me last night cannot be a real transaction otherwise a turnpike is a useless thing i do not believe in witchcraft or enchantment said i and if you will relate circumstantially what happened last night i will endeavour to account for it by natural means you may recollect the night was uncommonly dark well sir just after i had closed the gate for the night down the turnpike as far as my eye could reach i beheld what at first appeared to be two armies engaged the report of the musketry and the flashes of their firelocks were incessant and continuous as this strange spectacle approached me with the fury of a tornado the noise increased and the appearance rolled on in one compact body over the surface of the ground the most splendid fireworks rose out of the earth and encircled this moving spectacle the divers tints of the rainbow the most brilliant dyes that the sun lays in the lap of spring added to the whole family of gems could not display a more beautiful radiant and dazzling spectacle than accompanied the black horse you would have thought all the stars of heaven had met in merriment on the turnpike in the midst of this luminous configuration sat a man distinctly to be seen in a miserable looking chair drawn by a black horse the turnpike gate ought by the laws of nature and the laws of the state to have made a wreck of the whole and have dissolved the enchantment but no the horse without an effort passed over the gate and drew the man and chair horizontally after him without touching the bar this was what i call enchantment what think you sir my friend said i you have grossly magnified a natural occurrence the man was peter rugg on his way to boston it is true his horse travelled with unequalled speed but as he reared high his forefeet he could not help displacing the thousand small stones on which he trod which flying in all directions struck one another and resounded and scintillated the top bar of your gate is not more than two feet from the ground and rugg s horse at every vault could easily lift the carriage over that gate this satisfied mr mcdoubt and i was pleased at that occurrence for otherwise mr mcdoubt who is a worthy man late from the highlands might have added to his calendar of superstitions having thus disenchanted the macadamized road and the turnpike gate and also mr mcdoubt i pursued my journey homeward to new york little did i expect to see or hear anything further of mr rugg for he was now more than twelve hours in advance of me i could hear nothing of him on my way to elizabethtown and therefore concluded that during the past night he had turned off from the turnpike and pursued a westerly direction but just before i arrived at powles s hook i observed a considerable collection of passengers in the ferry boat all standing motionless and steadily looking at the same object one of the ferry men mr hardy who knew me well observing my approach delayed a minute in order to afford me a passage and coming up said mr dunwell we have a curiosity on board that would puzzle
sword against the french and indians in this land of promise he referred to the scriptural account of the march of the israelites from the land of egypt and the house of bondage and applied it literally as did many others to the emigration of the puritans and he derived his authority for much of his own conduct from the fighting part of the character of joshua the onondagas the tuscaroras the wampagoes and the potawatamies were with him but the other names for the hittites perezites jebuzites and gergushites all whom were to be exterminated indeed if father raal in his way from penobscot to his catholic friends had fallen into the hands of miles standish he would have considered the fate of agag as his sufficient warrant he possessed vigorous strength was patient of fatigue and fixed in his purpose a man as southey says firm to resolve and stubborn to endure he sat reading pilgrim s progress which he allegorized beyond the spirit of bunyan himself letter xi after hearing du quesne without interruption are you said he true men and no spies is it not to spy out the nakedness of the land ye are come you sir must be a frenchman and surely if ever i saw one this is an indian know you not that it is against such that i have come to fight i have the authority of scripture history it is in vain for the keemites to attempt deceiving me with their old shoes and clouted tattered garments and moldy bread and broken bottles the dialogue between them lasted some time the engaging manners and conversation of du quesne interested the chieftain though it was apparent he doubted the truth of the story and looked on the disinterested heroism of weshop particularly as apocryphal but aside from his incredulity and some strong suspicions of design he resolved not to cross the jake but to keep his provincials within the boundary of new england he cared as little for the dutch as for the french let them said he to himself fight it out between themselves and if the indians take sides so much the better great was the joy of du quesne when he heard that dudley his long lost and as he supposed far distant friend was on the spot and the second in command he hastened to his quarters where he found dubourg and his daughter standish was present at this cordial interview and listened once more but with greater confidence and interest to the story and request the anxiety of dudley was extreme he saw the emaciated form of du quesne worn down by famine fatigue and suffering represented to himself the exposure of van tromp to a fate from which it might even now be too late to save him and made up his mind i will go and that immediately if i go alone major standish said he this is no matter of political or provincial interest it is my private business and of great emergency providence gives me this opportunity perhaps the only one of redeeming a sacred pledge my sworn my bosom friend is in peril see said he pointing to weshop what an example even this man has set me ah he s a keenite said standish wringing weshop s hand worthy to be ranked with squantum himself in a case like this i will not be outdone by the best heathen that ever lived weshop but come there s no time to lose beat to arms i wish added he in a lower tone to dudley that weshop was a christian he would make a better one than some white men i know of but now have the boats ready i ll show you how to deal with indians when you catch them on fair ground in a body weshop you must lead us captain dudley we march indian file without music three ferriages will carry over as many as we want let the ladies stay with those who keep guard at the camp if i do nt return i ll send for them during the bustle of a slight and rapid preparation the young lady found means to set her large dark eyes on du quesne and beckon him towards her this sir said she is no time for ceremony or affected delicacy i feel interested for the safety of your friend i shall wait here oh with how much anxiety to hear of your arrival in time to save him and beg that as soon as it is safe i may be immediately sent for to join you and mr dudley at the blasted tree i know from your zeal you will save him i know you will but you have eaten nothing these hasty men have forgotten to ask you and you have forgotten to call here i will set a table for you and wait upon you myself i must not eat without my friend who the indian warrior that brought me here oh weshop i know him let me call him myself weshop came back but the honest fellow could not stay for a regular meal he took a quantity of provision in his hand to eat as he went onward to the place of embarkation saying as he left the shore make haste make haste the party in fine order and under strict discipline were soon paraded marched and wheeled to the landing the lake at a narrow place was ferried over again and again till all but a guard for the defence of the women and the few effects that were left behind had quit the shore miles standish directed the embarkation himself and brought up the rear in the last boat with his drummer trumpeter and bugleman and as he had an ear for music and a strong taste for sublime scenery he directed them to play old hundred and accompanied them with his
more daring in the declaration of his belief but it was not until the sabbath after ordination that he publicly evinced his adherence to the rites of the episcopal church a meeting was held in a vacant building which had been erected as a common house until more convenient dwellings could be procured here a considerable number were collected and the english ritual was read and the sacrament administered by mr blackstone in his full canonical robes according to the ceremonies prescribed by james and his bishops at the council of hampton house this was a thing not to be passed over mr blackstone living alone in his solitary hut at tri mountain was out of their jurisdiction but brown and his brother were the next morning ordered to appear before an assembly of the elders to answer the charges brought against them at o clock in the afternoon the inhabitants of salem were seen again collecting at their meetinghouse to hear what could be said in defence of the culprits after a suitable pause the governor arose as he said you mr charles and samuel brown are accused of fomenting disturbance among the people forasmuch as you have taught them that under the shadow of the mitre is the only place where men ought to worship do you plead guilty thereto that i bow with reverence before the holy mitre is most true governor endicott but in no respect whatever have i bred disturbance among the people have you not interrupted mr conant have you not made them drink of the wine of babylon yea have you not made them drunk with her fornication have you not like the red dragon pursued the church into the wilderness and poured out a flood after her that you might cause her to be destroyed my answers are to governor endicott and the elders of what you term the church replied brown with respectful coldness mr conant said the governor these things should be done decently and in order it is the business of men in authority to inquire into this matter have you young man upheld the ritual of the firstborn daughter of the church of rome and maintained that the arm of royal authority ought to enforce obedience thereto i have said replied brown that religio docenda est non coercenda was a bad maxim of state policy and that hresis dedocenda est non permittenda was a far better if by the first born daughter of rome you mean that church descended in a direct line from jesus christ and his apostles a church at the feet of which the most sacred and virtuous elizabeth bowed down her majestic head and beneath the shelter of whose mighty arm the learned king james and our liege prince charles have reposed their triple diadem if you mean this church i do say her sublime ritual should be enforced till every fibre of the king s dominions yields a response thereto saints have worn her white robe and her mitre has rested on holy men the sacred water hath been on my unworthy head and therewithal have their hands signed the mystic symbol of redemption and i would rather continued he raising the tones of his fine manly voice i would rather give my limbs
